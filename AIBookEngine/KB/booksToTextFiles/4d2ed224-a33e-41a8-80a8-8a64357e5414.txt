Communicating Across Cultures is an innovative short course for learners of  business English who want to function effectively in an international  environment by developing their intercultural skills in English. Drawing on  inspirational advice from leading figures in the world of cross-cultural  communication, Communicating Across Cultures covers all types of oral and  written communication, from meetings to negotiations, telephone calls to  emails, and deals with situations ranging from working in international  teams to managing conflict. Students are invited to analyse their own  intercultural competence and helped to develop a personal action plan for  further use beyond the classroom.    The Student's Book comes with an audio CD that contains authentic interviews  with people from the world of business and extracts from meetings that  exemplify the communication strategies presented.
