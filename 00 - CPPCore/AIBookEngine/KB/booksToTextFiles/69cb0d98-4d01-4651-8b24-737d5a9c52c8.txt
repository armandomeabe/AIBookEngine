Pea lives in a flat at Number 7 Evergreen Street. It's a grey building in a grey street, in a grey city. Inside the building, however, it's not grey at all. Pea and her parents have lots of amazing, colourful neighbours. One day, an army of construction workers turn up on the street and start putting up brand new buildings. When it looks like Number 7 Evergreen Street is going to be demolished, Pea has to think quickly to save her home. A special book that explores the value of communities and nature.
