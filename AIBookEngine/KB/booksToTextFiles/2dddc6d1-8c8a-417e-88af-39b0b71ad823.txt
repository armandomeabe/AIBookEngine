But two other young couples are not so happy: Hermia wants to marry Lysander, but her father doesn't agree. Helena loves Demetrius, but he wants to marry Hermia. The King and Queen of the Fairies don't love each other any more, so they start to play tricks on each other. They involve their fairies, the lovers and a group of Athenian workmen who want to be actors. It's a very unusual Midsummer Night, perhaps it's a dream.
