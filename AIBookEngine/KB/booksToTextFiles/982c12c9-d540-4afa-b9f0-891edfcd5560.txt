The Checkpoint English series consists of three books and one CD. Together  they form an incremental programme of work with clear goals aimed at raising  standards in English. - Each book is divided into units that cover the key  curriculum requirements of reading, writing, usage and speaking and  listening. - The units have been arranged across the three years to  establish, revisit and consolidate these skills. - The texts have been  chosen for their quality and richness in classroom study. - Activities are  designed to introduce pupils to the focus for the sequence of work and to  engage their interest. - Within each unit, several pages are given to  reinforcing new knowledge or skills in context. - Photocopiable pages  contain actitivites where a more hands-on approach is suitable. - Usage  sections focus attention on sentence structure, grammar, punctuation,  spelling and vocabulary. - Progression is built into each unit of study and  across the course as a whole. - Many of the units are free-standing,  allowing the flexibility to link them with other units or with material the  teacher has sourced from elsewhere. - The accompanying CD provides audio  support where it is most helpful to pupils and this is clearly indictaed  within the text by the CD icon.
