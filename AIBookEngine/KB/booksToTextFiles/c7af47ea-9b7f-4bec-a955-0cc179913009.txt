The toys have found a spaceship! Now they only need to figure out who will be the lucky one to go to space. Jim Giraffe is too tall to fit, Sally Sheep is afraid of the dark and Chickadoodle is just too little! Who will make it all the way through the countdown? Beautifully illustrated, QED Storytime introduces young children to the pleasures of reading and sharing stories. Supporting notes for parents and teachers are also included.
