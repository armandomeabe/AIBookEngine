Winnie and Wilbur love travelling by broomstick but recently the skies have become a rather dangerous place to be. Could a skateboard be safer? Or a bicycle, or a horse? Winnie discovers that even walking has its perils when she falls into a hole in the pavement. Perhaps the answer to theproblem is on the end of Winnie's nose? Previously published as Winnie Flies Again it's a high-flying Winnie and Wilbur adventure! Korky Paul's intricate artwork is full of madcap humour and crazy details to pore over.
