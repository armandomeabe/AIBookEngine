Its communicative approach gets students talking through play and teaches social and emotional skills alongside language.Jump In! supports you with an easy-to-teach methodology, lots of additional resources and the Classroom Presentation Tool with on-screen Class Book for 'heads-up learning', and integrated audio, video, and answers.Class Book includes stickers and pop-outs.The Class Book includes an access code for the Lingokids home learning app, which extends students' contact with English beyond the classroom. With colourful and interactive games, videos, and songs, children can practise the language and skills they have learnt in class at home in a fun and engaging fashion!
