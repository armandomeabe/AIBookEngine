Global Readings contains a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts, as well as activities for learners to explore literacy concepts, develop reading skills, and respond to what they have read. As they work through the programme, students improve their thinking and self-reflection skills, which will allow them to become more effective and independent readers.Taken from the much-loved Global Stage Literacy Book, this reading programme can be used alongside any English language course.This blended solution consisting of the print Student's Book and the Digital Student's Book is ideal for face-to-face or online classes. The Digital Student's Book includes interactive, self-marking activities as well as the audio and video content from the course.
