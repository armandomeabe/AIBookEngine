Based on extensive research, Grammar and Beyond ensures that students study accurate information about grammar and apply it in their own speech and writing. Student's Book, Level 3 is the main component of Grammar and Beyond. In each unit, students study the grammar in a realistic text and through charts and notes informed by a billion-word corpus of authentic language. The exercises provide practice in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, making this a complete course. Students learn to avoid common mistakes, based on an extensive corpus of learner language. Each unit concludes with a Grammar for Writing section, in which students apply the grammar in an extended writing task.
