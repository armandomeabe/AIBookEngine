ANOTHER DAY - EVERY DAY 2   9780385756235Edad recomendada: A partir de 15 añosDAVID LEVITHANWhen not writing during spare hours on weekends, David Levithan is editorial director at Scholastic and the founding editor of the PUSH imprint, which is devoted to finding new voices and new authors in teen literature. His acclaimed novels Boy Meets Boy and The Realm of Possibility started as stories he wrote for his friends for Valentine's Day (something he's done for the past 22 years and counting) that turned themselves into teen novels. He's often asked if the book is a work of fantasy or a work of reality, and the answer is right down the middle-it's about where we're going, and where we should be.SINOPSISABOUT ANOTHER DAYNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Celebrate all the ways love makes us who we are with this enthralling and poignant follow-up to the New York Times bestseller Every Day-now a major motion picture.David Levithan turns his New York Times bestseller Every Day on its head by flipping perspectives in this exploration of love and how it can change you.   Every day is the same for Rhiannon. She has accepted her life, convinced herself that she deserves her distant, temperamental boyfriend, Justin, even established guidelines by which to live: Don't be too needy. Avoid upsetting him. Never get your hopes up. Until the morning everything changes. Justin seems to see her, to want to be with her for the first time, and they share a perfect day-a perfect day Justin doesn't remember the next morning. Confused, depressed, and desperate for another day as great as that one, Rhiannon starts questioning everything. Then, one day, a stranger tells her that the Justin she spent that day with, the one who made her feel like a real person . . . wasn't Justin at all.
