DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS!Mo Willems' acclaimed picture book debut celebrates 20 years!When a bus driver takes a break in this hilarious Caldecott Honor-winning picture book, he gives the reader just one instruction: "Don't let the pigeon drive the bus!" But, boy, that pigeon tries every trick in the book to get in that driving seat: he whines, wheedles, fibs and flatters. Will you let him drive? Told entirely in speech bubbles, this brilliantly original and funny picture book demands audience participation!MO WILLEMSMo Willems (born February 11, 1968) is an American writer, animator, voice actor, and children's book author.
