Fred the dragon has a list of tasks he must complete in order to be a  successful dragon-none of which comes naturally. But he's determined to make  #5-eat people-work. Before you can say "pass the salt" he's gobbled up three  people even though he doesn't have the stomach for it. Luckily a local  shepherd, with the help of a giant and a witch, knows how to cure what ails  him and get those pesky people out of his belly. It's happily-ever-after for  everyone in ways you'd never expect.    Geisel award-winning author/illustrator Geoffrey Hayes is a stepped reader  maestro. The common threads between his wildly popular Uncle Tooth and Otto  SIRs and the more recent Benny and Penny series (Toon Books) are clear and  constant. The art is adorable, the characters are bursting with personality,  and the stories are humorously subversive. From marauding pirates to  misbehaving mice to a dragon who swallows people whole (and then continues  to communicate with them in his belly!), Geoffrey always hits that sweet  spot for the stepped reader audience-easy to decode, illustrative tales that  tickle the funnybone.
