A collection of nine exceptional stories from the much-loved author of The Catcher in the Rye A military sergeant meets a young girl immediately before he leaves for combat, a four-year-old boy runs away in a dinghy, a honeymoon in Florida goes tragically awry, a missionary's child is kidnapped by Chinese bandits. Including the first stories to feature Salinger's beloved Glass family characters, this brilliantly varied collection offers a vivid introduction to the work of one of the most admired and widely read American novelists of the twentieth century. Witty, urbane and frequently affecting, For Esme - with Love and Squalor sits alongside Salinger's very best work as writing that will be passed down for many generations to come.
