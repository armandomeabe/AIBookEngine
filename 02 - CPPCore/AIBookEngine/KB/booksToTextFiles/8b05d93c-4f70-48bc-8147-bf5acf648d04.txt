Business Goals is a three-level course in communicative Business English.  Each Student?s Book provides 30 core hours of class work extendable to over  60 hours using the additional material provided. Functional language,  vocabulary and grammar are introduced in manageable amounts. With a focus on  listening and speaking, learners are given the opportunity to build their  confidence in areas such as telephoning, ordering, networking and dealing  with problems in authentic business contexts. The Business Goals Workbooks  provide extra practice in all four skills and are also valuable for students  preparing for the BEC examinations, with BEC-style activities and exam  advice. Each Workbook comes with an audio CD and contains full transcripts  of all recordings. Model answers for speaking tasks are included on the CD.  An overview of how the Workbooks link to BEC exams is available on the  Business Goals website.
