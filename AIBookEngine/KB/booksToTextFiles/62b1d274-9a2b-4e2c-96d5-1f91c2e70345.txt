This innovative volume presents an in-depth study of the language used by  participants in business meetings. The cutting-edge research draws on the  Cambridge and Nottingham Business English Corpus (CANBEC), a unique resource  which brings together meetings of different types both within and between  companies, involving speakers whose roles and responsibilities vary, and who  represent a range of nationalities and first languages. Keywords,  concordance lines and discourse analysis provide thorough insights into  aspects such as the structural stages of meetings, participants' discursive  practices, interpersonal language and creativity, and power and constraint.  The author concludes by making practical suggestions for using these  findings to inform the teaching of business English.
