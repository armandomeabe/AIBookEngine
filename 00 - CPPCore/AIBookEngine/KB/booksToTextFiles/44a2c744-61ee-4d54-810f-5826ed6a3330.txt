With its four-letter words and its explicit descriptions of sexual  intercourse, Lady Chatterley's Lover is the novel with which D.H. Lawrence  is most often associated. First published privately in Florence in 1928, it  only became a world-wide best-seller after Penguin Books had successfully  resisted an attempt by the British Director of Public Prosecutions to  prevent them offering an unexpurgated edition. The famous 'Lady Chatterley  trial' heralded the sexual revolution of the coming decades and signalled  the defeat of Establishment prudery.    Yet Lawrence himself was hardly a liberationist and the conservativism of  many aspects of his novel would later lay it open to attacks from the  political avant-garde and from feminists. The story of how the wife of Sir  Clifford Chatterley responds when her husband returns from the war paralysed  from the waist down, and of the tender love which then develops between her  and her husband's gamekeeper, is a complex one open to a variety of  conflicting interpretations.
