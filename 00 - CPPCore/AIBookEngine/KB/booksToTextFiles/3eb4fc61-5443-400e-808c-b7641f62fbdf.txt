The most ambitious of Maugham's novels, this is  also one in which Maugham himself plays a considerable part as he wanders in  and out of the story. To observe his characters struggling with their fates.  "An immensely craftsman-like, amusing and imaginatively stimulating piece of  fiction...a fascinating book."-Times Literary Supplement "Here at last is a  great writer, on the threshold of old age, determined to tell the truth in a  form which releases all the possibilities of his art." -Cyril Connolly
