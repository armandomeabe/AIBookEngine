The Cambridge Lower Secondary Complete Chemistry Student Book builds a solid foundation in Lower Secondary Chemistry through a rigorous, separate science approach and develops the skills students need to prepare them for the step up to IGCSE.This resource fully covers the curriculum and prepares students for a smooth transition to IGCSE Chemistry.Written by Philippa Gardom-Hulme, author of our previous successful edition, this book provides an international approach that maintains the strengths of the previous edition, with updates and improvements to better meet students' needs.The Student Book is supported by a Workbook that provides opportunities for independent practice inside and outside the classroom, and a Teacher Handbook, which offers full teaching support.
