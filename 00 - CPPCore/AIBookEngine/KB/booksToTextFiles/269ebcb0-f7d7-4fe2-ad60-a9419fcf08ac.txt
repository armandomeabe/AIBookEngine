The Cambridge Lower Secondary Complete Mathematics 7 Student Book ensures students fully cover and excel in the curriculum, as well as embedding the learning they need to progress smoothly towards IGCSEÂ® Mathematics.This resource provides a rigorous approach for teaching and studying Cambridge Lower Secondary Maths to ensure students learn everything that is required at that level. However, stretching materials and exercises also prepare students for a smooth transition to IGCSE Mathematics by supporting thedevelopment of required skills.It is written by the expert author of our previous, best-selling edition and maintains the strengths of the original book, but with updates and improvements to better meet students' and teachers' needs.The Student Book is supported by a Homework Book that provides opportunities for independent practice inside and outside the classroom, and a Teacher Handbook, which offers full teaching support.
