Comprehensive student-friendly resources designed for teaching Cambridge International AS and A Level English Language (syllabus 9093). The core aim of this Coursebook is to help students to develop and apply the key skills they need to achieve in AS and A Level English Language. They will build the skills needed for assessment through frequent activities. Divided into two distinct parts for AS and A Level studies, the book covers a wide range of reading skills, such as understanding aspects of style, voice and tone. It also addresses the conventions of key kinds of writing and spoken language, from scripted speeches to travel articles, and looks at how they can capture these conventions in their own work.
