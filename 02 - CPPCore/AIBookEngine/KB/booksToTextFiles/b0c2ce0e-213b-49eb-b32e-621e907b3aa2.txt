How can you be a good global citizen? By understanding the world we live in and how we can effect change. This book explores the issues around diversity in modern life from the positives around multiculturalism to prejudice, racism and discrimination. It features a case study on Apartheid and ideas for how we can activate against racism.The I'm a Global Citizen series explores the concept of 'Global Citizenship': recognising that the world we live in is unfair and unequal, but promoting individual and collective action to challenge and change this. Each book has information, fun activities, challenges, case studies and ideas for group and individual action presented with fun illustrations. The books promote the idea that we have power as individuals: each of us can change things, and each of us has choices about how we behave. They encourage children aged 8+ to counter ignorance and intolerance?.
