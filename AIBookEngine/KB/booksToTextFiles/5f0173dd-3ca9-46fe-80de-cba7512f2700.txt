GLOW - THE PLATED PRISONER 4I have burned down the court of King Midas and from those flames, I will rise and wield my own power.The problem is, the world won't let me.Because when you turn against a King - everyone turns against you.But with Slade by my side we will fight the monarchs that come for us.And if we need to become the villains, then so be it.Because as long as I live in this world, I won't be used again.I must be strong. I must be undefeatable. I will shine like the sun - and blind my enemiesRAVEN KENNEDYRaven Kennedy is a tea and dark chocolate kind of girl and can often be found binge-watching The Office or The Great British Baking Show.She enjoys writing all kinds of books, because each one brings a different experience. Whatever the genre, she hopes she creates characters you can root for.When she's not reading or writing, she's with her family, probably messing up a recipe or going on a hike that she thinks she can do, but in reality she can't because she remembers that all she does is sit at a computer all day and write her heart out.Edad: Adultos j√≥venes
