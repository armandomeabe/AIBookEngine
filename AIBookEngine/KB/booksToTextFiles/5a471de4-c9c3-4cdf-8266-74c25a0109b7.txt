The Metro Student Book is made up of interesting topics which appeal to students' natural curiosity and sense of fun, answering the questions today's teens want to know. The accompanying Workbook mirrors and reinforces the content covered in the Student Book.The Online Homework, also included in this pack, allows students to practise the material covered in class and track their own progress. Students can begin to take responsibility for their own learning and view their areas of strength and weakness.
