MUSIC FOR CHAMELEONSIn these gems of reportage Truman Capote takes true stories and real people  and renders them with the stylistic brio we expect from great fiction. Here  we encounter an exquisitely preserved Creole aristocrat sipping absinthe in  her Martinique salon; an enigmatic killer who sends his victims  announcements of their forthcoming demise; and a proper Connecticut  householder with a ruinous obsession for a twelve-year-old he has never met.  And we meet Capote himself, who, whether he is smoking with his cleaning  lady or trading sexual gossip with Marilyn Monroe, remains one of the most  elegant, malicious, yet compassionate writers to train his eye on the social  fauna of his time.TRUMAN CAPOTETruman Garcia Capote (born Truman Streckfus Persons; September 30, 1924 - August 25, 1984) was an American novelist, screenwriter, playwright and actor.
