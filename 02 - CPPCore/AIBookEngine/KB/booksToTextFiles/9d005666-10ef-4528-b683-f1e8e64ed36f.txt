Los Angeles is all about the sweet life: hot clubs, cute guys, designer . .  . everything. Nineteen-year-old Jane Roberts can't wait to start living it  up. She may be in L.A. for an internship, but Jane plans to play as hard as  she works, and has enlisted her BFF Scarlett to join in the fun.     When Jane and Scarlett are approached by a producer who wants them to be on  his new series, a "reality version of Sex and the City," they can hardly  believe their luck. Their own show? Yes, please!     Soon Jane is TV's hottest star. Fame brings more than she ever imagined  possible for a girl from Santa Barbara-free designer clothes, the choicest  tables at the most exclusive clubs, invites to Hollywood premieres-and she's  lapping up the VIP treatment with her eclectic entourage of new pals. But  those same friends who are always up for a wild night are also out for a  piece of Jane's spotlight.     In a city filled with people chasing after their dreams, it's not long  before Jane wakes up to the reality that everyone wants something from her,  and nothing is what it seems to be.     L.A. Candy is a deliciously entertaining novel about what it's like to come  of age in Hollywood while starring in a reality TV show, written by a girl  who has experienced it all firsthand: Lauren Conrad.
