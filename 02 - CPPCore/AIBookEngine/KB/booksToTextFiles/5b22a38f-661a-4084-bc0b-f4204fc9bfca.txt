The bestselling author of "This Is Where I Leave You" returns with a  hilarious and heart-rending tale about one familiy's struggle to reconnect.  "Mistakes have been made." Drew Silver has begun to accept that life isn't  going to turn out as he expected. His fleeting fame as the drummer for a  one-hit wonder rock band is nearly a decade behind him. His ex-wife is about  to marry a terrific guy. And his Princeton-bound teenage daughter Casey has  just confided in him that she's pregnant--because Silver is the one she  cares least about letting down. So when Silver learns that he requires  emergency life-saving heart surgery, he makes the radical decision to refuse  the operation, choosing instead to spend what time he has left to repair his  relationship with Casey, become a better man, and live in the moment--even  if that moment isn't going to last very long. As his exasperated family  looks on, Silver grapples with the ultimate question of whether or not his  own life is worth saving.
