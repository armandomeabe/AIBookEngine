Hippo and Friends is a three-level pre-school course for 3-5 year-olds. It  uses a song and story-based approach to introduce language to children in a  way that comes naturally at this age. Actions and activities further  reinforce learning. The course is packed full of attractive illustrations  which immediately engage and delight young learners. The four lovable  characters, Hippo, Monkey, Dog and Cat, provide a safe and friendly setting  for each English lesson.     The stories in each unit are designed to encourage positive attitudes in  children such as helping others and sharing. There are also optional extra  units on festivals such as Christmas, Easter and Halloween in the Teacher's  Book. At the end of each unit children have the opportunity to make a simple  'storybook' which they can take home with them. This takes English outside  the classroom, making the language more meaningful, and enables parents to  be involved in the learning process.     The course is very easy to teach and is suitable for schools offering from 1  to 5 lessons a week, as each unit is divided into five carefully structured  lessons which revise and expand on the key language. The full-colour  Teacher's Books contain step-by-step lesson plans and useful classroom  management techniques. There are also plenty of ideas for extra activities  which offer the teacher flexibility and choice.
