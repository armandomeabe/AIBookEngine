DO IT NOW !!Become the scriptwriter of the story of your life and the creator of your own advancement and success.W. Clement Stone's First Commandment of Success is Do It Now!From his point of view, those of us who follow his advice achieve more, experience less stress, live with fewer regrets, become more self-disciplined, and demonstrate personal perseverance. All these qualities contribute to making our world a better place to live simply by doing it now.In his research, Dr. Napoleon Hill found that a successful synchronized system was needed that included the principles of interaction. These principles address the mental, social, physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual aspects of the human being holistically.By reading one chapter a week and following through with the actions appropriate to the message, in a very short period, you will be recognized for being a person who takes charge and moves forward. By having personal initiative accompanied by a positive mentality, you will decree your future with a single action.Start now, don't delay your reward. Do it now!Judith WilliamsonDirector Napoleon Hill Global Learning Center
