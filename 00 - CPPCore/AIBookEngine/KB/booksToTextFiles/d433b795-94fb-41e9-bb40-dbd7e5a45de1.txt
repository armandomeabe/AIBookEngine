Exciting and engaging material supports key themes from the new Programme of  Study. * Differentiated, colour-coded tasks offer well-structured  progression to motivate every pupil. * A clear focus on chronology and a  greater balance of British, European and World History increases the  relevance of the subject to the current generation of pupils. * All four  required periods are covered - the medieval, early modern, industrial and  20th century -- to ensure your pupils receive a complete grounding in  history.
