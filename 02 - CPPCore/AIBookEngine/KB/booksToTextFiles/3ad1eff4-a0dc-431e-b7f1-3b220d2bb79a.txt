Pygmalion both delighted and scandalized its first audiences in 1914. A  brilliantly witty reworking of the classical tale of the sculptor Pygmalion,  who falls in love with his perfect female statue, it is also a barbed attack  on the British class system and a statement of Shaw's feminist views. In  Shaw's hands, the phoneticist Henry Higgins is the Pygmalion figure who  believes he can transform Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, into a  duchess at ease in polite society. The one thing he overlooks is that his  'creation' has a mind of her own.
