Interactive is an exciting four-level course for teenage learners from  elementary to upper-intermediate levels (CEF A2-B2). The Teacher's Resource  Pack contains two communication-based 'Interaction' activities, as well as a  page each of Grammar and Vocabulary practice per unit. The activity pages  are all photocopiable for students.    Photocopiable Picture Dictionary pages provide students with practice in the  vocabulary learned as they first label the pictures, and then keep them as a  handy visual reference
