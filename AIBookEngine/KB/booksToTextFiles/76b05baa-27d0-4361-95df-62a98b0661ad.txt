Nick Lortz is sitting outside a cafand#233; in Whistler, a village in the  Canadian mountains, when a stranger comes and sits next to him. She's young,  pretty, and has a beautiful smile. Nick is happy to sit and talk with her.  But why does she call Nick 'Mr Hollywood'? Why does she give him a big kiss  when she leaves? And who is the man at the next table - the man with short  white hair? Nick learns the answers to these questions three long days later  - in a police station on Vancouver Island.
