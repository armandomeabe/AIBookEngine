Return to a darker Oz with Gregory Maguire. In A Lion Among Men, the third volume in Maguire's acclaimed, New York Times bestselling series The Wicked Years, a fuller, more complex Cowardly Lion is brought to life and gets to tell his remarkable tale. It is a story of oppression and fear in a world gone mad with war fever-of Munchkins, Wizards, and Wicked Witches-and especially of a gentle soul and determined survivor who is truly A Lion Among Men.
