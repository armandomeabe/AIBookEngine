George likes to write. Harold likes to draw. They figure all superheroes look like they're wearing underpants - and so a new comic-book superhero is born. And this one's got Wedgie Power! The boys are just as creative in real life too. At the big football game, they put pepper in the cheerleaders' pom-poms, helium in the football, and itching powder in the coach's muscle rub. And Mr. Krupp, the mean principal, films it all! Now the boys have to behave, or else. That is, until their hypnotizing ring arrives. Then watch out, Principal Krupp!
