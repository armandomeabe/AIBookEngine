"An excellent beginner's resource for biography, U.S. history, and women's studies." -Kirkus ReviewsHere is the powerful and inspiring biography of Dorothea Lange, activist, social reformer, and one of the founders of documentary photography.After a childhood bout of polio left her with a limp, all Dorothea Lange wanted to do was disappear.But her desire not to be seen helped her learn how to blend into the background and observe. With a passion for the artistic life, and in spite of her family's disapproval, Lange pursued her dream to become a photographer and focused her lens on the previously unseen victims of the Great Depression.This poetic biography tells the emotional story of Lange's life and includes a gallery of her photographs, an author's note, a timeline, and a bibliography.
