Discover the power of reading, writing and language instruction working together to move students to grade-level performance.Learn the FundamentalsStudents who begin in Levels A and B need sequential work in phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, and spelling as well as foundational work in vocabulary, language, and writing.Build Reading and Writing PowerThe students who begin in Levels C-E have more advanced language proficiency and have learned to read, but they need intensive work to build academic vocabulary and language, to learn reading strategies, and to develop skill in comprehension, literary analysis, and writing.Language development lessons promote the use of more complex language functions and grammar. They greatly expand vocabulary and develop facility with non-literal language. Reading skills and strategies spiral across the levels and are taught with text at increasingly higher reading levels.Complete Writing Coverage and SupportA comprehensive scope and sequence of writing in every book supports instruction from sentences and paragraphs as the basic building blocks to the writing process and into writing applications that connect directly to standards.
