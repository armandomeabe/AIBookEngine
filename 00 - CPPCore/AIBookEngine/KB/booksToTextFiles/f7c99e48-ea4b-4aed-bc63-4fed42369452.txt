Tom Clancy returns with a #1 New York Times bestseller that will remind  readers why he is the acknowledged master of international intrigue and  nonstop military action.     It is The Campus. Secretly created under the administration of President  Jack Ryan, its sole purpose is to eliminate terrorists and those who protect  them. Officially, it has no connection to the American government-a  necessity in a time when those in power consider themselves above such  arcane ideals as loyalty, justice, and right or wrong.    Now covert intelligence expert Jack Ryan Jr. and his compatriots at The  Campus-joined by black ops warriors John Clark and "Ding" Chavez-have come  up against their greatest foe: a sadistic killer known as the Emir.  Mastermind of countless horrific attacks, the Emir has eluded capture by  every law enforcement agency in the world. But his greatest devastation is  yet to be unleashed as he plans a monumental strike at the heart of America.    On the trail of the Emir, Jack Ryan Jr. will find himself following in his  legendary father's footsteps on a manhunt that will take him and his allies  across the globe, into the shadowy arenas of political gamesmanship, and  back onto U.S. soil in a race to prevent the possible fall of the West.
