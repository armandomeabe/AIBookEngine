Each level consists of 8 theme-based units plus a shorter Starter unit. Centred on the Engage, Study, Activate methodology, each lesson is highly structured, building students' knowledge and confidence before culminating in a final productive exercise to enable students to personalise what they have learnt.A strong communicative strand runs throughout the Student's Book with plenty of speaking exercises and an entire lesson dedicated to speaking and pronunciation skills.Video is integrated into Vocabulary lessons to help students capture the target language and put it into context. Grammar Animations can be used alongside every Grammar lesson to reinforce the rule being taught and make language structures more memorable.On-page features such as Key Phrases and Study Strategy boxes support students while developing their ability to learn independently. Fast Finisher activities throughout every unit and Options pages at the back of the Student's Book provide opportunities to expand on the core material to suit different learner types.
