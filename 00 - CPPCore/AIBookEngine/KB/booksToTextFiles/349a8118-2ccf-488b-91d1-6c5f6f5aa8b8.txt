An immediate best-seller on publication, Ben Hur remains a dazzling achievement by any standards. A thoroughly exhilarating tale of betrayal, revenge and salvation, it is the only novel that ranks with Uncle Tom's Cabin as a genuine American folk possession.This was the book that finally overcame the inherent suspicion of fiction that still prevailed in much of America in the late nineteenth century.Wallace writes with a freshness and immediacy that brings every action-packed scene to life and vividly illuminates the geography, ethnology and customs of the ancient world.
