American MORE! is a four-level course from a highly respected author team  that's bursting with features for lower secondary students. The Teacher's  Resource Pack contains unit tests, review tests, and term tests, as well as  entry-level tests and end-of-year tests. There are extra grammar practice  and communication activities for each unit of the course.    The free Testbuilder CD-ROM/Audio CD allows teachers to create their own  tests. It previews each exercise before inclusion, and can create 'A' and  'B' versions of each test so that students sitting next to each other don't  share answers. Exam skills (KET-, PET- and Trinity-style) questions are also  available.
