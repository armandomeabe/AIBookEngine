A go-cart contest inspires imagination to take flight in this picture book for creators of all ages, with art from New York Times bestselling illustrator Peter H. Reynolds.It's time for this year's Going Places contest! Finally. Time to build a go-cart, race it-and win. Each kid grabs an identical kit, and scrambles to build.Everyone but Maya. She sure doesn't seem to be in a hurry...and that sure doesn't look like anybody else's go-cart!But who said it had to be a go-cart? And who said there's only one way to cross the finish line?This sublime celebration of creative spirit and thinking outside the box-both figuratively and literally-is ideal for early learners, recent grads, and everyone in between.
