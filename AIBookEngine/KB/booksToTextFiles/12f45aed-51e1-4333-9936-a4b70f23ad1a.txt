With her 1847 novel, Jane Eyre, Charlotte BrontÃ« created one of the most unforgettable heroines of all time. Jane Eyre is an orphan, penniless and plain, but full of courage and spirit. She has endured incredible hardship to secure her humble status as a governess in the household of her brooding employer, Mr. Rochester. Jane's sharp wit and defiant nature meet with Rochester's sardonic temperament. The two become enmeshed in a deep, intense bond. But Rochester has a terrible secret-a remnant from his past that could threaten any hope of  happiness with his only love. An unconventional love story that broadened the scope of romantic fiction, Jane Eyre is ultimately the tale of one woman's fight to claim her independence and self-respect in a society that has no place for her.
