I have colourful feathers and a sharp beak. Can you guess who I am? Guess Who's Noisy introduces young children to some of their favourite noisy animals. With six lift-and-look flaps this book is perfect for little hands! Each book encourages children to work out who each animal is, with the help of written questions and clues, and visual hints such as a furry pattern peeking out from behind a bush. By lifting the flap the answer is revealed!
