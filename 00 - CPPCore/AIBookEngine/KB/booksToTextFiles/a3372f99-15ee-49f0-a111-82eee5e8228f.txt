How we look after water is something that will greatly affect the future of our Earth and the wellbeing of its inhabitants.This book asks children to think about the questions: What do you know about water? How much water is there on Earth and why is it so important? What do you know about the animals that live in our oceans, rivers and lakes? Are we looking after this vital natural resource? It also tells three stories from different parts of the world about how children have dealt with problems related to water.SyllabusVocabulary areasmaterials, wild animals, nature, time, workGrammar and structuresPresent simple and continousPresent perfectWill for future referenceGoing to for future referenceHave to for obligationShould for adviceComparative and superlative adjectivesInfinitive of purposeIn this Reader you will find:Games and language activities | An audio recording of the story | A picture dictionaryTagsCaring for the natural world | Taking the initiative | Collaboration
