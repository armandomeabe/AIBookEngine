Following on the heels of the successful alphabetic phenomenon, Countablock features thick pages cut into the shape of each number, creating a sort of peek-through guessing game around the number form itself. One egg becomes...one chick!From snowmen to puddles and acorns to oaks, quantities are illustrated twice: both before and after their "transformations." As children interact with the pages, they will familiarise themselves not only with the numbers 1-100 and associated quantities, but with each numeral's physicality -- angles, holes and curves, both front and back.Illustrated by hip British design team Peskimo, this fresh take on the 1-2-3s encourages readers to manipulate numbers in a whole new way.
