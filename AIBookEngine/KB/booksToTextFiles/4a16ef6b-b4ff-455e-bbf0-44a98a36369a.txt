Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) thought motherhood would be a breeze and that  having a daughter was a dream come true - a shopping friend for life! But  it's trickier than she thought - two-year-old Minnie has a quite different  approach to shopping. She can create havoc everywhere from Harrods to Harvey  Nicks to her own christening. She hires taxis at random, her favourite word  is 'Mine', and she's even started bidding for designer bags on ebay. On top  of everything else, there's a big financial crisis. People are having to Cut  Back - including all of Becky's personal shopping clients - and she and Luke  are still living with Becky's Mum and Dad. To cheer everyone up, Becky  decides to throw a surprise birthday party - on a budget - but then things  become really complicated. Who will end up on the naughty step, who will get  a gold star and will Becky's secret wishes come true?
