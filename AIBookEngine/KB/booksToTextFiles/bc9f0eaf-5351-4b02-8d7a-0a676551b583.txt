War brought them together. Love will tear them apart.This fantastic second installment of the Falling Kingdoms series picks up in the middle of thrilling drama that made the first Falling Kingdoms novel a New York Times bestseller. The kingdom of Auranos--and Princess Cleo along with it--has been conquered and the three kingdoms of Auranos, Limeros, and Paelsiaare now unwillingly united as one country called Mytica. But alluring, dangerous magic still beckons, and with it the chance to rule not just Mytica, but the world. When King Gaius announces that a road is to be built into the Forbidden Mountains, formally linking all of Mytica together, he sets off a chain of cataclysmic events that will forever change the face of this land.
