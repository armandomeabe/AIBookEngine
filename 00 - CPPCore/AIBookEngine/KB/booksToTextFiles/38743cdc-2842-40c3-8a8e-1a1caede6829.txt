Active Listening, Second Edition, is grounded in the theory that learners  are more successful listeners when they activate their prior knowledge of a  topic. Teacher's Manual 3 contains step-by-step practical teaching notes,  optional speaking activities and listening strategies, culture notes, and  suggested times for completing lessons. Photocopiable unit quizzes, two  complete tests with Audio CD, and complete answer keys are also included.
