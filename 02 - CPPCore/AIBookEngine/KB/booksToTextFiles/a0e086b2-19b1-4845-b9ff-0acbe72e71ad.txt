I'll admit it: I'm a cheesy mouse from time to time. I'm a romantic! That's why Valentine's Day is one of my favorite holidays. This year I had a date with a very special rodent - Patty Spring! But then I got a call from my private investigator friend. He had a mystery to solve, and needed my help. Holey cheese, what was a gentlemouse to do?
