Then one day a nightingale threatens to eat him if he cannot measure his song. Children will enjoy the clever inchworm's solution and delight in finding the tiny hero on every page.Every inch the classic, this was the first of Lionni's books to win the Caldecott Honor."The lovely colors, the sharp definition of cutouts against white space, the rhythm of the composition, and the simplicity of the whole make a handsome and appropriate book to give pleasure to little children and their elders."-The Horn Book Magazine
