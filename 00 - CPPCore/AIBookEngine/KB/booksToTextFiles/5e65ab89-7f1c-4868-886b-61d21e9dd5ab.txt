The latest addition to the Macmillan Business Skills series, Networking in  English is for anyone who finds it hard to find the right words when  communicating informally in the workplace. It is a practical, engaging and  easyto-use book that will build confidence in a difficult area. Networking  in English focuses on the factors that make a good socialiser/communicator:  using appropriate functional expressions in common social situations; having  effective conversations which build rapport and mutual understanding;  considering social etiquette and being sensitive when communicating with  different cultures. The authors have considerable experience of teaching  communication skills and cultural awareness, and are therefore perfectly  placed to guide students in the art of networking in a language which is not  their own. Suitable for the classroom or for self-study.
