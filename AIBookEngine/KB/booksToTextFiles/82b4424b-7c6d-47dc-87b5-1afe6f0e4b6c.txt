Leo isn't just a stuffed toy, he is Henry's best friend and brother. He is as real as a tree, a cloud, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the wind. But when the two are accidentally separated, no one in Henry's family believes Leo is real enough to find his way home. With beautiful mixed-media paintings, the Caldecott Honor-winning artist Pamela Zagarenski explores the transcendent nature of friendship and love.
