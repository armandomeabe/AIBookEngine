A lion trapped in a net and an ant in a puddle. Who will rescue them and so gain a new friend?These are two stories from the Aesop's Fables collection, which have stood the test of time and been read and loved by generations all over the world. At their heart, the stories have important lessons. The first is that, when we need help, it can come from the most unexpected of places! The second is an illustration of Aesop's own saying: 'No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.'
