ALL MY RAGENow, Sal scrambles to run the family motel as his mother Misbah's health fails and his grieving father loses himself to alcoholism. Noor, meanwhile, walks a harrowing tightrope: working at her wrathful uncle's liquor store while hiding the fact that she's applying to college so she can escape him-and Juniper-forever. When Sal's attempts to save the motel spiral out of control, he and Noor must ask themselves what friendship is worth-and what it takes to defeat the monsters in their pasts and the ones in their midst.   From one of today's most cherished and bestselling young adult authors comes a breathtaking novel of young love, old regrets, and forgiveness-one that's both tragic and poignant in its tender ferocity.SAABA TAHIRSabaa Tahir is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Ember in the Ashes series, which has been translated into over thirty-five languages.
