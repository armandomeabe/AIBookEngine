Developing Skills for the TOEIC Test is designed for intermediate-level  students of English who need to refine their skills in preparation for the  TOEIC test. It is recommended for students currently in the 500 to 700 score  range. It is divided into 14 units that focus on different grammar points  commonly found in the new-format TOEIC test. Each unit is presented in the  form of a mini test featuring questions that follow the same style and  format as the actual TOEIC, but with modified vocabulary and structure to  familiarize students with the test using language appropriate to their  level. A complete practice test is also included. Answer keys and  audioscripts are included for all mini tests and the practice test. Answer  explanations are also included for the Incomplete Sentences and Incomplete  Texts sections. The accompanying CDs (3 discs) contain recordings for  completing the listening sections. CD 1 covers Units 1 to 7; CD 2 covers  Units 8 to 14; and CD 3 covers the practice test.
