Merry Team is a six-level English course for children in Primary School, who  have had some exposure to the language. It covers the curriculum  requirements for the English language. Each level of the course offers  sufficient material for between 80 and 90 lessons, including evaluation.  Each lesson takes approximately 45 to 60 minutes, but the teacher's guide  provides suggestions for extending or reducing lessons. The general aim of  the course is to teach English as a means of communication and to develop  young learners' knowledge of a different culture. For this reason, language  is presented within a context and the children are given the opportunity to  use it in a pleasant, motivating and supportive atmosphere. In this way  children feel that they can understand and do things in English, thus  developing not only their ability to communicate but also their selfesteem  and general education.
