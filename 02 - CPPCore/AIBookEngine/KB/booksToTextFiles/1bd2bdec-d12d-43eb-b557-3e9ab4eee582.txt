In a poem about a Mama Fox's unconditional love for her cub, this story describes the many moods of all children-from happy to frightened, bashful to silly, and more-and will reassure them of their parents' abiding affection and approval. Truly remarkable watercolor illustrations from David McPhail, sensitively wrought and never saccharine, are the perfect complement to Liza Baker's rhythmic, rhyming text. This book has quickly become a family favorite-and an enduring classic of the genre.
