Product Description  On the Polar ice-cap, 640 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, the deadly,  icy winds can freeze a man to death in minutes. But the survivors of the  crashed airliner are lucky - they are rescued by three scientists from a  nearby weather station. But why did the airliner crash in the first place?  Who smashed the radio to pieces? And why does the dead pilot have a bullet  hole in his back? The rescue quickly turns into a nightmare: a race through  the endless Arctic night, a race against time, cold, hunger - and a killer  with a gun.
