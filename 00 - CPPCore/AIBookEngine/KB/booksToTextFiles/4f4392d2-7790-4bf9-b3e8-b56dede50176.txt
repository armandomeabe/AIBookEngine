Including an introduction from writer and feminist activist Scarlett Curtis, curator of Sunday Times Bestseller Feminists Don't Wear Pink.When wealthy Sara Crewe arrives at Miss Minchin's boarding school in London, she is determined to settle in and make friends.Charismatic and popular, with a big heart and a love of storytelling, she seems to be succeeding.Her father always said she was a Little Princess, and she knows exactly what it means to be a princess: to be kind, understanding and polite.That is, until tragedy strikes. Sara must fight harder than she thought possible to remain both strong and kind in the most difficult of circumstances.
