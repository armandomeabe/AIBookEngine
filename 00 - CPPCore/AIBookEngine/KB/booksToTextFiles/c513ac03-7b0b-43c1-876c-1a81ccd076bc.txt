DIALOGUESStoic philosopher and tutor to the young emperor Nero, Seneca wrote moral dialogues -exercises of practical philosophy- on how to live in a troubled world. These essays are strikingly applicable today, as Seneca ranges widely across subjects such as shortness of life, tranquility of mind, anger, mercy, happiness, and grief by the loss of a loved one. Seneca is considered one of the great stoics and many refer to his Dialogues as a manual on how to live ethically. In his dialogues, Seneca writes on various topics in an attempt to console, guide, and advise his friends and colleagues. Through these letters and essays, Seneca extolls the pragmatism within stoicism and guides readers on a journey of what it means to live life with virtue.SENECA(CÃ³rdoba, Spain 4 BC - Rome, Italy 65 AD) He was a Stoic Roman philosopher, statesman, and dramatist.
