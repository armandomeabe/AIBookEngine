It's a universal problem - no matter how hard they try, children just can't get to sleep! Perhaps counting sheep will help? But these sheep aren't content with merrily skipping over fences. Instead they come to life and decide to explore the house! Falling through the chimney, nibbling at the rug, dancing on the stairs, bouncing on the bed - will they ever be able to soothe a little girl to sleep? Perhaps a kiss from the littlest of lambs will help.Join one little girl as she struggles to close her eyes in this fun picture book with dream-like illustrations from Ximo Abadia.
