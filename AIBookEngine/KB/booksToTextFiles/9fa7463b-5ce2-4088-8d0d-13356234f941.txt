Written by an experienced IGCSE teacher and trainer and endorsed by CIE,  this series is up to date and comprehensive in its coverage. Cambridge  English as a Second Language Coursebook 1 is a one-year, theme-based  intermediate English course. It is ideal for students who are not yet ready  to start a demanding, exam-focused course such as the International General  Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) in English as a Second Language  (E2L). Coursebook 1 can be used as a stand-alone resource, but it is an  ideal foundation for studying Coursebook 2, Third edition, which is a  two-year exam course for IGCSE which will properly prepare candidates for  the Cambridge E2L examination.
