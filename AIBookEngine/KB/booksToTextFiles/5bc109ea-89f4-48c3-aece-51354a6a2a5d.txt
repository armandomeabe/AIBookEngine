A new generation of reference books for kids used to surfing and swiping.Within the last five years, more has been discovered about dinosaurs than ever before. By commissioning brand-new digital images and talking to "in the field" paleontologists, Dinosaurs is not only up-to-date, but stunning to look at. The book is ordered chronologically and gives the best, current information about which dinosaurs lived when, and what each was like. Details of the fossil record encourage budding paleontologists to think about why we know what we know, and make discoveries for themselves. The book ends with an interview with a dinosaur expert, a look at some dino record breakers, and insight into what happened to the dinosaurs. Is it possible that we still live with dinosaurs today?
