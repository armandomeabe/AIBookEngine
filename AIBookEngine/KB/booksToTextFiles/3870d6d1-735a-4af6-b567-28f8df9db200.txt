Larson is a marvelous writer...superb at creating characters with a few  short strokes."-New York Times Book Review      Erik Larson has been widely acclaimed as a master of narrative non-fiction,  and in his new book, the bestselling author of Devil in the White City turns  his hand to a remarkable story set during Hitler's rise to power.     The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America's  first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning  point in history.     A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and  flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and  pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious  enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored  of the "New Germany," she has one affair after another, including with the  suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as  evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person  testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State  Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the  press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As  that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days  full of excitement, intrigue, romance-and ultimately, horror, when a  climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and  ruthless ambition.
