There is also a Teacher's Resource Centre available online with assessment and home/school materials. The Bebop Band App connects the classroom with home through stories, songs and games so parents can support their child's learning.The Bebop Teacher's Editions are all spiral-bound and interleaved with the Student's Books pages. The Book begins with an introduction and is then followed by detailed sections on classroom management, musical development, digital materials, teaching with Total Physical Response and using American Sign Language to support language learning.
