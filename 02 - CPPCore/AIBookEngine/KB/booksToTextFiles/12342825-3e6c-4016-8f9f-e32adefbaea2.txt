This is a 'New Windmills Collection' of stories from the literary heritage  paired with stories by contemporary writers. Based on the recommended  authors list in the revised Key Stage 3 curriculum, this collection brings  together great authors from the literary heritage and the best contemporary  writers. The book is divided into four sections each of which introduces  readers to a different genre. A six lesson scheme of work and assessment  task accompanies each genre. Each contemporary story is paired with a story  from the literary heritage to help make classic literature more accessible.  The pairing of stories encourages comparisons between texts, helping  students to develop an important skill required at GCSE.
