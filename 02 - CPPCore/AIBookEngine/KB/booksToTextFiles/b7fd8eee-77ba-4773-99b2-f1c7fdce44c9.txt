Each level of Practical Grammar has 100 units, divided into modules of five  units. Each module examines a particular area of grammar. The grammar is set  in short, everyday conversations or texts, showing the language in natural  situations which students will find engaging and can relate to. Students  then examine the form, meaning and use of the language before practising it  in a variety of activity types.    A Review section concludes each module and regular tests check students'  progress.    Each level comes with two audio CDs and a pin code which allows access to  MyPG for extensive additional online practice for use at home or in  self-access centres.
