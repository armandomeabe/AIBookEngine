Bullied at school, nagged in Aunty May's 10th-floor tenement, there's only  one place Billy really feels alive: in the wilderness by the canal. There he  watches a cygnet on the water and he protects a family of fox cubs. Then his  secret place is discovered and the fox family is decimated. Unwanted and  unloved, Billy and the last fox run for their lives.
