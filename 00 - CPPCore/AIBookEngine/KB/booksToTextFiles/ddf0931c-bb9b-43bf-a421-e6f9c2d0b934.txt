One of Shakespeare's most political plays, Julius Caesar continued  Shakespeare's interest in Roman history, first developed in Titus  Andronicus. Drawing on Plutarch, the great historian of Rome, Shakespeare  dramatises one of the most crucial moments in Roman history--the  assassination of Julius Caesar. Loved by the Roman crowd but increasingly  feared by the Senators, Caesar increasingly shows signs of his desire to  abolish the Republic and crown himself emperor. A conspiracy is hatched, led  by Cassius and Brutus, who murder Caesar on the steps of the Capitol.  Mourning over his dead friend's body, Mark Antony gives one of the famous  rhetorical speeches in literature, asking "Friends, Romans, Countrymen" to  lament Caesar's death, privately vowing to "let slip the dogs of war"  against those who have shed Caesar's blood. Antony joins forces with  Caesar's son Octavius to defeat Cassius and Brutus in battle, and establish  an uneasy alliance whose collapse is dramatised in Shakespeare's later play  Antony and Cleopatra. Written at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, Julius  Caesar has been seen by many as a radically pro-Republican play which sailed  close to the political wind of the time. --Jerry Brotton --This text refers  to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title
