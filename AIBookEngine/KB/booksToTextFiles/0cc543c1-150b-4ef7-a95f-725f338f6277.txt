THE GREAT GATSBY - YOUNG ADULT HUB READERS 5 (C1) - 978-88-536-3261-6Nivel: C1Francis Scott Fitzgerald. Adaptation and activities by Richard J. Larkhman.SINOPSISScott Fitzgerald's third novel was published in 1925 and has justifiably become a 20th century literary classic.  "Gatsby?" asked Daisy urgently.  "What Gatsby?" Could it be the same young army lieutenant whom Daisy Fay met five years ago - and who owns a sumptuous house on Long Island, where New York society enjoys the best parties on offer? Is it just coincidence that Gatsby lives across the bay from Daisy - now married to wealthy polo-player Tom Buchanan? As one man's mysterious dream moves towards its ultimately tragic conclusion, Midwesterner Nick Carraway is drawn into the dark world of Gatsby's past and present - a world of hidden frustrations and superficial relationships which perfectly illustrates the "careless and confused" nature of America's Jazz Age.
