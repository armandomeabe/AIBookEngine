Health is not just about a person's diet, fitness, and genes. Life  expectancy, or how long people are likely to live, is also a reflection of  the society in which people live. A society's culture, politics, economy,  and access to health care all have a tremendous impact on people's world.  People are working to bring better access to doctors and nurses to improve  everyone's health.  Case Study: Nigeria / Romania
