A complete three-year lower secondary computing course that takes a real-life, project-based approach to teaching young learners the vital computing skills they will need for the digital world. Each unit builds a series of skills towards the creation of a final project, with topics ranging from designing your own robot to programming simple games and designing and creating web pages. Within each stage, key concepts are covered to give learners not only the skills they need to use technology effectively, but also the knowledge in how to do so creatively, safely and collaboratively: - Understand how modern technology works - Use a wide range of computer hardware and software for analytical and creative tasks - Use the internet safely, respectfully, and selectively - Write computer programs and develop computational thinking
