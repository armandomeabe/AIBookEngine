O'Malley and Chamot review the literature on learning strategies, describe  and classify learning strategies in second language learning, and discuss  why learning is affected in a positive manner when such strategies are used.  The authors present instructional models for learning-strategy training that  teachers can apply to their own classes. The material is based on current  research in second language acquisition and cognitive theory.
