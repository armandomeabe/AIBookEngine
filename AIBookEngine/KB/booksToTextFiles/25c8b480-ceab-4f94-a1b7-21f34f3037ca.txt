THE NO. 1 BESTSELLER The Wilderness Years are over! But for how long? Bridget's second diary takes us through a year that begins with man-of-her-dreams Mark Darcy (who never does the washing up) and lurches onwards through a sea of self-help books and lunatic advice from her mad friends. Struggling with the challenges of a boyfriend-stealing beauty, an eight-foot hole in the wall and a builder obsessed with large reservoir fish, Bridget decides it's time for a spiritual epiphany. And so she departs Notting Hill for the sparkling shores of Thailand ...Bridget is back. V.g. 'A glorious read ...there is a laugh on every page' Sunday Times 'The best, the original, the seminal' Mail on Sunday 'Devastatingly funny' Daily Telegraph
