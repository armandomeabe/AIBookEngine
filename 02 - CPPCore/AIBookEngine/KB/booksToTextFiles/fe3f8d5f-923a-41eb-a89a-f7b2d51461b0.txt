Objective IELTS is a 2-level IELTS preparation course providing  comprehensive training for both the Academic and General Training modules.  The course is uniquely informed by the Cambridge Learner Corpus, using  analysis of real IELTS candidate papers. The 2 levels of Objective IELTS can  be used on their own or consecutively, so that lower-level students  requiring a high band score can start preparing early. This self-study  Student's book includes a CD-ROM which provides extra IELTS practice in each  of the four skills. In order to access the class audio, refer to our  Objective IELTS Advanced Audio CDs (3).
