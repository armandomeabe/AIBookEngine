"I will ever be grateful for the almost psychic gift that enabled me to write "Blithe Spirit" in five days during one of the darkest years of the war."-Noel Coward.Written in 1941, "Blithe Spirit" remained the longest-running comedy in British Theatre for three decades. Plotted around the central role of one of Coward's best loved characters, a spirit medium Madame Arcati (originally performed by Margaret Rutherford) Coward's play is an escapist comedy about a man whose two previous wives return to haunt him.
