Finally available in paperback-the #1 New York Times bestseller from the  author of Big Little Lies and What Alice Forgot.    At the heart of The Husband's Secret is a letter that is not meant to be  read...    My darling Cecilia,  If you're reading this, then I've died...    Imagine your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death.  Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret-something  with the potential to destroy not only the life you have built together, but  the lives of others as well. And then imagine that you stumble across that  letter while your husband is still very much alive.    Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all-she's an incredibly successful  businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, a devoted wife and mother.  Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to  change everything-and not just for her. There are other women who barely  know Cecilia-or each other-but they, too, are about to feel the  earth-shattering repercussions of her husband's secret.
