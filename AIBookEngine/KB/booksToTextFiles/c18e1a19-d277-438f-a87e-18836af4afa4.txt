These are two of Hans Christian Anderson's most popular stories.In The ugly duckling the farmyard animals reject a little duck because he is different. In The princess and the pea beautiful princesses turn out to have not very beautiful characteristics and a poor girl turns out to be a true princess. In both stories children are led to be sympathetic to the unpopular characters. The lessons behind the stories are important for children. Think for yourselves, be kind and don't jump to conclusions; you can't always go by appearances!SyllabusVocabulary areasfarm animals, colours, family,adjectives for describing peopleGrammar and structuresPresent simplePresent continuousHas / Have gotThere is / areAdverbsQuestion words: Who? / What? / Which?TagsEmpathy | Kindness to others | Not jumping to conclusions | Citizenship
