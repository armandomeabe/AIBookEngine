English Result is a completely new multi-level general English course for  adults. A unique two-page lesson formula combines highly visual input on the  left-hand page with classroom activities on the right-hand page.    Key features  * 'How to...' lessons provide a clear learning focus and practical language  that students can use in everyday situations.  * A whole page of visually stimulating input maximizes student interest at  the beginning of each lesson and keeps motivation high throughout.  * 21st-century grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation syllabus with  five-skills coverage gives teachers and students everything they need.  * 'Put it all together' sections in every lesson help students consolidate  what they've learned before they leave the classroom.  * An 'I can...' tick line at the end of every lesson helps students reflect  on how well they can use the language.  * A one-page writing lesson per unit consolidates language covered and  builds up to a practical written outcome.
