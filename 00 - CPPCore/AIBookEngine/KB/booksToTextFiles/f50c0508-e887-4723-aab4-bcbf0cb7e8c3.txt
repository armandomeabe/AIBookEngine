Essential Academic Vocabulary prepares students for academic success by  helping them preview, learn, and practice vocabulary from the Academic Word  List in context. Engaging academic readings highlight chapter vocabulary in  context. From chapter to chapter, the readings and vocabulary increase in  complexity level, allowing students to establish and build upon a solid  vocabulary foundation.
