Jeffrey Archer's first novel, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, is page-turning tale of fraud, revenge and determination as four men stop at nothing to get back what was stolen from them.One million dollars - that's what Harvey Metcalfe, lifelong king of shady deals, has pulled off with empty promises of an oil bonanza and instant riches. Overnight, four men - the heir to an earldom, a Harley Street doctor, a Bond Street art dealer and an Oxford don - find themselves penniless. But this time Harvey has swindled the wrong men. They band together and shadow him from the casinos of Monte Carlo to the high-stakes windows at Ascot and the hallowed lawns of Oxford.Their plan is simple: to sting the crook for exactly what they lost - not a penny more, not a penny less.'Marvellously plotted, with just the right amounts of romance, wit and savoir-faire' Publishers Weekly'There isn't a better storyteller alive' Larry King'Archer is terrific and meets the reader's ultimate tests - to want to turn the page, to want to know what happens next' Sunday Times
