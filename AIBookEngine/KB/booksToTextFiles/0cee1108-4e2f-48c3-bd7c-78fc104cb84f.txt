A successful editor at a publishing house in Manhattan, she's also a devoted sister, aunt, and friend.

Then she meets her soul mate Ben who, miraculously, feels the same way about parenthood. The two fall in love and marry, committed to one another and their life of adventure and discovery. All's well until one of them has a change of heart.
