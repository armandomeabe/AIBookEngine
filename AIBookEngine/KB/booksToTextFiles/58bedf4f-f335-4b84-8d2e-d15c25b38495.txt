I AM NOT AN OCTOPUSA brilliantly funny story of facing your fears from the picture book team behind The Case of the Missing Cake.Terry is not an octopus. He's just a regular guy with a few extra arms. Yes, he loves tuna and yes, he'd love to visit Super Octopus Fantasea Adventure World. But octopuses live in the sea. And Terry is afraid of water. Maybe he should learn to swim? A very silly story about being brave, facing your fears and accepting who you really are.EOIN MCLAUGHLINEoin McLaughlin is a bestselling Irish children's writer.
