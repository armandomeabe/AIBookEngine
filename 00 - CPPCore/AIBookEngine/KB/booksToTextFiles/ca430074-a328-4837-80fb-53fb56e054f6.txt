Collins Primary Geography has been developed to provide full coverage of curriculum requirements for geography in the primary school. The four Key stage 2 primary geography books provide a progressive, skills-based scheme for the junior years. Each book is divided into units covering physical, human, and environmental geography. There are also case studies of contrasting localities in the UK, Europe, Asia, and the wider world. The pupil books use an extensive range of evidence to stimulate the children?s interest and encourage investigative skills?photographs, maps, satellite images, artwork, charts, and diagrams. Each pupil book has an accompanying teacher?s guide which contains copymasters. Locations focused on in Book 5 include England, the European Union, the United States of America, and Kenya.
