Learning Teaching" has been one of the most successful guides to English  since it was first published in 1994. Its no-nonsense approach has made it a  superb teaching textbook for initial training courses, and also an essential  handbook for practising ELT teachers. The third edition has been extensively  revised and restructured to take recent developments in ELT into account and  now includes a DVD featuring a full lesson being taught as well as  demonstrations of practical teaching techniques.
