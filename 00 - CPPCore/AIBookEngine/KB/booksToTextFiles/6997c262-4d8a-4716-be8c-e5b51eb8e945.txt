Ideal for: Secondary teachers focusing on developing the four skills in the context of the 21st century classroom. Beyond is a new vibrant six-level course for teenagers, with a focus on developing strong linguistic skills as well as teaching the wider strategies your students need to improve as language learners. Beyond follows a practical sub-skills syllabus, equipping students with strategies they can transfer to other areas of their education. The age-appropiate, 21st century life skills lessons ensure students not only develop academically, but also grow into considerate and confident individuals. The regular use of multimedia materials, class and homework activities on the Resource Centres ensures that your students are learning from a variety of resources.The Beyond Workbook provides students the chance to consolidate their learning throughout the course. Every Workbook unit includes extra grammar and vocabulary consolidation pages, which are cumulative throughout the book and therefore provide thorough language recycling. The Workbooks are ideal as a homework tool or for use in class.
