Pollution is growing problem around the globe. Used chemicals, old  appliances, exhaust fumes, and plastics are just a few of the things that  cause pollution on our planet. "Pollution" examines how water, soil, and the  atmosphere have become increasingly polluted and the impact that pollution  has on people's health. In the face of these challenges, people and  countries have cooperated to clean up natural environments. They are also  working to prevent pollution through technology, better planning,  transportation alternatives, and more.  Case Study: Mexico City / Magnitogorsk
