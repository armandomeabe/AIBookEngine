Arthur Miller's classic parable of mass hysteria draws a chilling parallel  between the Salem  witch-hunt of 1692 - "one of the strangest and most awful  chapters in human history" - and the McCarthyism which gripped America in  the 1950s.  The story of how the small community of Salem is stirred into madness by  superstition, paranoia and malice, culminating in a violent climax, is a  savage attack on the evils of mindless persecution and the terrifying power  of false accusations.
