Communicative Language Teaching    The communicative approach is changing the face of foreign language  teaching. It provides an introduction to communicative language teaching for  practising classroom teachers. The author gives a single coherent account of  the basic communicative ideas, emphasizing those aspects most important in  the classroom so that teachers can integrate the new ideas into their own  familiar methods. He stresses that a knowledge of grammar remains essential  for effective communication.
