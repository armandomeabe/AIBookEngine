Introduction and Notes by David Blair. University of Kent at Canterbury    It is 1757. Across north-eastern America the armies of Britain and France  struggle for ascendancy. Their conflict, however, overlays older struggles  between nations of native Americans for possession of the same lands and  between the native peoples and white colonisers. Through these layers of  conflict Cooper threads a thrilling narrative, in which Cora and Alice  Munro, daughters of a British commander on the front line of the colonial  war, attempt to join their father. Thwarted by Magua, the sinister 'Indian  runner', they find help in the person of Hawk-eye, the white woodsman, and  his companions, the Mohican Chingachgook and Uncas, his son, the last of his  tribe.    Cooper's novel is full of vivid incident- pursuits through wild terrain,  skirmishes, treachery and brutality- but reflects also on the interaction  between the colonists and the native peoples. Through the character of  Hawkeye, Cooper raises lasting questions about the practises of the American  frontier and the eclipse of the indigenous cultures.
