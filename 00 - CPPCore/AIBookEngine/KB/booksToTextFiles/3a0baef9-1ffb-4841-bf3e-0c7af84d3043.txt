Gina D. B. Clemen, Laura Stagno    Pre-intermediate (B1)    British History Seen Through Art relates the significant events of British  history with a detailed commentary on the most important works of art of the  period, which are beautifully presented in full colour.  Starting with Stonehenge, we see history unfold before our eyes. We observe  how the religious art of the Middle Ages became more secular after the reign  of Henry VIII, and how continental European art influenced British  architecture and painting.  We witness important changes in British society: the rise in power of the  middle classes in the Georgian Age and how this influenced British painting;  the new artistic expression brought by the Industrial Revolution; and the  advent of technology of the 20th and 21st centuries and a new freedom of  artistic expression.  British History Seen Through Art has its own website,  www.Britishhistoryart.com, with links to other sites where you can find out  more about the themes introduced in each chapter and work on corresponding  activities.  Both students and teachers will enjoy this cross-curricular approach to the  study of the history of Britain and its art, which also features PET-style  exercises, an Exit Test and a recording of the text with listening  activities.
