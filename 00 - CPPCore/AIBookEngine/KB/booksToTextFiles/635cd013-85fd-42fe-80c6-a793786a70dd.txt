With high-tension suspense and cutting-edge technology, Patricia  Cornwell-the world's #1 bestselling crime writer-once again proves her  exceptional ability to entertain and enthrall in this remarkable novel  featuring chief medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta.     On her quest to find out exactly what happened to her former deputy chief,  Jack Fielding, murdered six months before, Scarpetta drives to the Georgia  Prison for Women to meet a convicted sex offender and the mother of a  vicious and diabolically brilliant killer. Against the advice of her FBI  criminal intelligence agent husband, Benton Wesley, Scarpetta is determined  to hear this woman out.     Scarpetta has both personal and professional reasons to learn more about a  string of grisly killings: the murder of a Savannah family years earlier, a  young woman on death row, and then other inexplicable deaths that begin to  occur at a breathtaking pace. Driven by inner forces, Scarpetta discovers  connections that compel her to conclude that what she thought ended with  Fielding's death and an attempt on her own life is only the beginning of  something far more destructive: a terrifying terrain of conspiracy and  potential terrorism on an international scale.    And she is the only one who can stop it.
