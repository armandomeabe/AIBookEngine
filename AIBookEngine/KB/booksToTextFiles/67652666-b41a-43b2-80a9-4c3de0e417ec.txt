JAPAN - THE ULTIMATE SAMURAI GUIDEPart Samurai history, part martial arts guide, this is THE book for anyone interested in Japan's fabled Samurai culture.Author Alexander Bennett is the ultimate insider--holding multiple black belts in Kendo and Naginata, as well as a Ph.D. in Japanese literature and history. In this book he shares his vast personal experience and knowledge with readers seeking to undertake their own personal quest in the Japanese martial arts.Bennett outlines the Japanese history of Bushido and the Samurai--from early times up until the present. Then, as only someone steeped in this world can, he surveys the contemporary martial arts scene and provides the essential knowledge young foreigners need to find a teacher and learn successfully. Unlike any other book on this subject, Japan The Ultimate Samurai Guide is written by a Japanese speaker who has studied and taught martial arts in Japan for many decades.Chapters include:The Real SamuraiThe Concept of BushidoDevelopment of the Japanese Martial ArtsMartial Arts Masters You Should Know AboutBudo in Japan TodayKey Martial Arts ConceptsLife in a Japanese DojoA Japan Survival GuideWritten in a down-to-earth and easy-to-read style, this book will captivate anyone interested in Japan, as well as martial arts teachers and practitioners around the world. With both history and humor, this vividly illustrated book has a more personal touch than many (for example, read up on "Fifteen Famous Japanese Cultural Indiosyncrasies" and Bennett's favorite martial arts movies).As Bennett says, "This book is supposed to be genuinely from the heart. Without the pretense...misconceptions or romantization that often accompanies martial arts."Edad recomendada: A partir de 15 a√±os.
