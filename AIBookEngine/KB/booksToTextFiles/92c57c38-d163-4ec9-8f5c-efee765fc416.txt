Fudge is back-and driving his brother Peter crazy, as usual. This  five-year-old human hurricane is more trouble than ever. His latest plan is  to marry Peter's sworn enemy, Sheila Tubman (how disgusting!).  But Peter's problems are about to get worse. His parents have decided to  share a summer house with the Tubmans. And Peter will be stuck with Fudge  and Sheila the Cootie Queen for three whole weeks!    It's going to be an unforgettable (and hilarious) trip for both families,  filled with old friends and new ones, plenty of surprises and lots of  laughs. It may not be the vacation of Peter's dreams. But as millions of  Judy Blume fans know, it won't be dull. Because with Fudge around, anything  can happen.and does!
