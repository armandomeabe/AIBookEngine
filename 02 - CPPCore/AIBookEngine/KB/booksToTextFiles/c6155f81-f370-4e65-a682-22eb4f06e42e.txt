"The Jungle Book, originally published in 1894, brings together seven short stories, all equally inspiring and unforgettable, about the fragile relationship between man and animals. Here we will meet the beloved Mowgli, adopted by a family of wolves, who protect him and integrate him into his herd.Little Mowgli will live under the threat of Shere Khan, a tiger who wants to devour him, but will have the help of Baloo, a funny bear and Bagheera, a protective panther, who will teach him the law of the jungle, the languages of the animals and the dangers that lurk, and together they will live a memorable adventure.The animals themselves will think about the way in which they must face the difficulties imposed on them by men.Let's dive into the depths of the Indian jungle with the noblest emotions that remain intact in children and our most faithful friends: animals."
