There's a smell I can't ignore.It's wafting through the kitchen door.It's time for me to find out more.I think it might be cake.How do you resist the most amazing cake ever? Especially when your mum has left a note saying that you MUST NOT eat the cake?This wonderful rhyming text from Simon Philip, author of You Must Bring a Hat, is illustrated with huge energy and humour by Lucia Gaggiotti.
