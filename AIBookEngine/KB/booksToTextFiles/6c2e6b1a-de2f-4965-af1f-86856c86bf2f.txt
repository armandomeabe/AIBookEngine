Introduction and Notes by Dr John Bowen, Keele University    Illustrations by Marcus Stone    Considered by many to be Dicken's finest novel, Great Expectations traces  the growth of the book's narrator, Philip Pirrip (Pip), from a boy of  shallow dreams to a man with depth of character. From its famous dramatic  opening on the bleak Kentish marshes, the story abounds with some of  Dicken's most memorable characters. Among them are the kindly blacksmith Joe  Gargery, the mysterious convict Abel Magwitch, the eccentric Miss Haversham  and her beautiful ward Estella, Pip's good-hearted room-mate Herbert Pocket  and the pompous Pumblechook. As Pip unravels the truth behind his own 'great  expectations' in his quest to become a gentleman, the mysteries of the past  and the convolutions of fate through a series of thrilling adventures serve  to steer him towards maturity and his most important discovery of all - the  truth about himself.
