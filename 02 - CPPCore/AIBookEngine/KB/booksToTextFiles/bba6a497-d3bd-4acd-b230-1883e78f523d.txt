It is a hot afternoon and Alice is bored. She follows a White Rabbit down a rabbit hole and arrives in a strange place called Wonderland. Here nothing is as it seems: animals can talk, cakes and drinks can make you bigger and smaller and the Queen of Hearts can cut off your head. Can Alice find her way home again?Recording in British English.
