Illustrated by Steve Noon    Revised and updated for a new generation!    In the bestselling A City Through Time, readers are invited to follow the  progress of an imaginary city through six key periods of time, each captured  by a scene of the city and zooming in on key buildings like a Roman  bathhouse, medieval castle, and a modern skyscraper. Illustrations by  award-winning artist Steve Noon provide a unique history of city life,  transporting readers from an early Greek settlement to an industrial  metropolis, while pull-outs surrounding the illustrations introduce the  reader to the people who lived there, from Greek slaves to modern-day  commuters.    New to this edition is a photographic section exploring amazing real-life  cities - from ancient Babylon to Constantinople to 21st-century Tokyo.    Supports the Common Core State Standards.
