Greg Mortenson stumbled, lost and delirious, into a remote Himalayan village  after a failed climb up K2. The villagers saved his life, and he vowed to  return and build them a school. The remarkable story of his promise kept is  now perfect for reading aloud. Told in the voice of Korphe's children, this  story illuminates the humanity and culture of a relevant and distant part of  the world in gorgeous collage, while sharing a riveting example of how one  person can change thousands of lives.
