This book is edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, Professor of  English Literature, University of Sussex. Henry V is the most famous and  influential of Shakespeare's history plays. Its powerful patriotic rhetoric  has resounded down the ages, gaining eloquent expression in Laurence  Olivier's renowned film. Henry himself, astute and charismatic, who led his  'band of brothers' to victory in the Battle of Agincourt, could indeed seem  to be 'this star of England'. In recent decades the play has attracted  increasing critical attention and is now highly controversial. Kenneth  Branagh's film-production reflected the changing valuation. Does this play  have a sceptical sub-text which subverts its patriotism? Is Henry's  achievement beset by irony? Has current scepticism distorted a predominantly  and proudly nationalistic drama?
