Big Fun teaches young children English - by listening, imitating and  repeating - in the same way that they learn their native language. And they  grow confident to speak English on their own.     Starting with basic vocabulary and language, Big Fun teaches children  English in the context of eight engaging themes. They learn about math,  reading and writing readiness, values and nature as they practice motor  skills and have fun doing creative projects.   The audio program includes vocabulary, conversations, narration and original  songs and chants to delight both your students and you.    Big Fun prepares students for a natural and positive experience with  language.  Communication: because young children like to express their interests and  ideas.  CLIL: because young children are learning English and so much more.  21st Century Skills: because young children need to be prepared for the  world that awaits them.  Assessment for Learning: because awareness and confidence lead to success.  Fun theme-related activities fill the book and CD-ROM of all eight units.  Show Time help students keep track of what they are learning. The Amazing  nature segment allows students to explore the natural world, with a hands-on  project to extend this learning. Little Books promote children's interest in  reading and provide an important home-school connection.
