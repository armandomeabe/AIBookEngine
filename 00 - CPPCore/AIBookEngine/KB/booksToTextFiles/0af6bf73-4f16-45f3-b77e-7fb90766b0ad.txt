CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLSThe tiny town of Chewandswallow was very much like any other tiny town  except for its weather which came three times a day, at breakfast, lunch and  dinner.   But it never rained rain and it never snowed snow and it never blew just  wind. It rained things like soup and juice. It snowed things like mashed  potatoes. And sometimes the wind blew in storms of hamburgers.   Life for the townspeople was delicious until the weather took a turn for the  worse. The food got larger and larger and so did the portions.  Chewandswallow was plagued by damaging floods and storms of huge food. The  town was a mess and the pople feared for their lives.   Something had to be done, and in a hurry.Edad recomendada: A partir de 6 a√±os
