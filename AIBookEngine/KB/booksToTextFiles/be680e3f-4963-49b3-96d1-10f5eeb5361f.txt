After Katie gets caught teasing a schoolmate, she's told to meet with Mrs.  Petrowski, the school counselor, so she can make right her wrong and learn  to be a better friend. Bothered at first, it doesn't take long before Katie  realizes that bullying has hurt not only the people around her, but her,  too. Told from the unusual point of view of the bullier rather than the  bullied, Confessions of a Former Bully provides kids with real life tools  they can use to identify and stop relational aggression.
