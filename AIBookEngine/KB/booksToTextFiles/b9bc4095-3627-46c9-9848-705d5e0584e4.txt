Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a genius, the most brilliant musician the world  will ever see. But the court of eighteenth-century Vienna doesn't recognize  his talents - only Antonio Salieri, the Court Composer, does, and he is  tortured by what he hears. Seething with rage at the genius of this flippant  buffoon and suddenly aware of his own mediocrity, Salieri declares war and  sets out to destroy the man he sees as God's instrument on earth. Peter  Shaffer's award-winning play is a rich, exuberant portrayal of a God-like  man among mortals, and lives destroyed by envy.
