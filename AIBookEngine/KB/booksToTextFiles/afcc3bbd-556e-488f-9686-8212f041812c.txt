Follow the narrator as he takes us through the good and bad aspects of micro-organisms in this fun rhyming poem by Sam McBratney, explaining that while these unseen bugs can ruin food and make us ill, they also keep our world under control, by rotting food and plants that we no longer need. Lively illustrations by Eric Smith accompany the poem.
