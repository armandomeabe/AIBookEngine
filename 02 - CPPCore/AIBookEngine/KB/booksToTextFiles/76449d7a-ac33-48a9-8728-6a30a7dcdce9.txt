Phoebe loves her pet fish, Betty #2 (named after Betty #1, may she rest in  peace), making lists, and her best friend Sage. But when Camille, a tall  French girl, arrives at school with unusual lunches, Phoebe's friendship  with Sage doesn't seem so important anymore. Thanks to Camille, Phoebe  discovers goat cheese, butter lettuce, and cilantro (although she's  convinced that's not a real word). She's determined to get invited to her  new friend's house for dinner to see what other mysterious food Camille  eats. But what about Sage? Can Phoebe make a new friend and keep an old one?
