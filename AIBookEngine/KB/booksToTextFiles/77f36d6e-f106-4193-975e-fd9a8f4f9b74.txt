The Cambridge Lower Secondary Complete Biology Student Book builds a solid foundation in Lower Secondary Biology through a rigorous, separate science approach and develops the skills students need to prepare them for the step up to IGCSE.This resource fully covers the curriculum and prepares students for a smooth transition to IGCSE Biology.The book provides an international approach from author, Ann Fullick, teacher and subject specialist author of nearly 200 textbooks. It maintains the strengths of the previous, best-selling edition, but with updates and improvements to better meet students' needs.The Student Book is supported by a Workbook that provides opportunities for independent practice inside and outside the classroom, and a Teacher Handbook, which offers full teaching support.
