Everyone has the magic within!Grandpa Tu is famous for his special noodles, and as the emperor's birthday approaches, he teaches his granddaughter, Mei, the family trade. Mei struggles to find the magic needed to make noodles. Ultimately, she finds the magic - and the ability to succeed - within. Mei doesn't just make noodles - her magic noodles in varied shapes and sizes rain down from the sky!Noodle Magic is written in the style of a Chinese folk story, with engaging cultural and community aspects. The family connection that's at the heart of the story has universal appeal. The grandfather and granddaughter work together to accomplish what one could not do alone. Meilo So, whose Brush of the Gods received four starred reviews, brings the story to life with breathtaking illustrations.
