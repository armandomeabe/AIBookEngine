With an Introduction by Roger Clark, University of Kent at Canterbury   Translation by Eleanor Marx-Aveling     Castigated for offending against public decency, Madame Bovary has rarely  failed to cause a storm. For Flaubert's contemporaries, the fascination came  from the novelist's meticulous account of provincial matters. For the  writer, subject matter was subordinate to his anguished quest for aesthetic  perfection. For his twentieth-century successors the formal experiments that  underpin Madame Bovary look forward to the innovations of contemporary  fiction.    Flaubert's protagonist in particular has never ceased to fascinate. Romantic  heroine or middle-class neurotic, flawed wife and mother or passionate  protester against the conventions of bourgeois society, simultaneously the  subject of Flaubert's admiration and the butt of his irony - Emma Bovary  remains one of the most enigmatic of fictional creations.    Flaubert's meticulous approach to the craft of fiction, his portrayal of  contemporary reality, his representation of an unforgettable cast of  characters make Madame Bovary one of the major landmarks of modern fiction.
