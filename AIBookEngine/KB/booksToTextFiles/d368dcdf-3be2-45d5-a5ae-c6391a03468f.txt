Messages is a four-level course for lower-secondary students. There are six  modules of two units per level, each divided into three manageable steps.  Clear aims and outcomes for each step mean students can put what they learn  into practice immediately.    Each level of the course provides 80-90 hours of classwork with lots of  recycling in regular four-page sections. Level 1 assumes students have  studied English at primary school, but gives full coverage of all basic  language areas. The course takes students to an intermediate level by the  end of Level 4.    The Teacher's Resource Pack provides photocopiable tests, extra activities  and drills.
