A moving, insightful, sensitive and entertaining novel exploring first love and first heartbreak, for older readers, from phenomenally bestselling author Jacqueline Wilson.      Sylvie and Carl have been friends since they were tiny children. They've always played together, called each other boyfriend and girlfriend and, deep down, Sylvie has always believed that they'd end up married to each other. They even have a a magical fantasy world that belongs to them alone.     But as they become older, things are starting to change. Sylvie would still rather spend all her time with Carl -- but Carl has a new friend, Paul, who is taking all his attention. Now, Carl seems much less happy to be called Sylvie's boyfriend -- and in a game of spin the bottle, he avoids having to kiss her. Sylvie can tell his feelings have changed and that their future together might not be so clear-cut after all. But can she guess at the true reasons behind it all?      Touching and compelling, Kiss is a delicately handled treatment of love and sexuality from award-winning Jacqueline Wilson.
