Edited, Introduced and Annotated by Cedric Watts, Professor of English  Literature, University of Sussex     This is an intense drama of love, deception, jealousy and destruction.  Desdemona's love for Othello, the Moor, transcends racial prejudice; but the  envious Iago conspires to devastate their lives. In its vivid rendering of  racism, sexism, contested identities, and the savagery lurking within  civilisation, Othello is arguably the most topical and accessible tragedy  from Shakespeare's major phase as a dramatist.
