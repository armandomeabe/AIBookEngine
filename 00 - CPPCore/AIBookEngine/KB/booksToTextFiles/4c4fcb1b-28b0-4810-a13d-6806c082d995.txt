THE LOST WORLD - READING & TRAINING 2 (B1.1)At the beginning of the 1900s the whole world has been explored. There is nothing left to discover. But maybe this is not totally true. The eccentric Professor Challenger says that there is a place where time stopped, where dinosaurs still live. All the other scientists do not believe him. So, Professor Challenger decides to lead an expedition to this prehistoric world located in the middle of the great Amazon forest.With this fantastic adventure, Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, showed that he could also write great science fiction. The Lost World has also inspired some of the most popular films of recent years, including King Kong and Jurassic Park.Dossiers:Amazonia: a Land of WondersDinosaursAuthor	Sir Arthur Conan DoyleAdapted by	Frederick GarlandLanguage	ENGLISHGenre	AdventureLevel	B1.1Examinations	Preliminary, Trinity
