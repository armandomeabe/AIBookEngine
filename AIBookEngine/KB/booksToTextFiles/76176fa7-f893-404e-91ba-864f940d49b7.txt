SynopsisThe Gruffalo is an internationally bestselling picture book, a popular stage show, a BAFTA and Oscar-nominated animation - and now the story has been adapted into a fun and accessible play script by Julia Donaldson.Ideal for children to use as a school play or at home, The Gruffalo Play has been designed with rehearsals and performance in mind. A clear layout and colour-coding for each character will help children to follow their lines and join the action with ease.The book also contains a hints and tips section which includes helpful advice on staging the play and performing it with larger groups. There are ideas too for themed make-and-do Gruffalo activities, as well as stage make-up for Gruffalo and Mouse! And of course no production of The Gruffalo Play would be complete without the lyrics and music for beloved Gruffalo Song.With Axel Scheffler's fun illustrations, this wonderful, dramatic way to share the classic story is sure to delight teachers, parents and children everywhere.
