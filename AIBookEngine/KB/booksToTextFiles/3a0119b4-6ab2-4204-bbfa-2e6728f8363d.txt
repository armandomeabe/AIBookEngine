It was fun for Kathy to work with William and the others at the Helping Hand  Club ... until she met the strange lady in Room 16 at the Old Peopleïs Home.  The ladyïs story about Hampton House and its master changed her life  completely! Now everybody suspects her of being a liar and, worst of all,  William wonït speak to her again. Will anybody believe her?
