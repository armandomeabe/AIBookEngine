Product Description  When the Magic Tree House whisks Jack and Annie off to Hawaii it's for more  than a vacation-they're in search of a fourth kind of magic for Morgan! On  the way they help an island community survive a tidal wave and, of course,  take some time out to surf! Ultimately, they discover that the magic that  they have found in this set of four books are everyday magics: the magic of  the arts, the magic of the natural world, the magic of community; and the  magic of fun.
