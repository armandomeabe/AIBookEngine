CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS AND THE PREPOSTEROUS PLIGHT OF THE PURPLE When we last saw George and Harold, they were about to take their pet pterodactyl, Crackers, back to the Cretaceous period in the Purple Potty time machine. But things didn't work out quite as they had hoped. They've entered an absurd alternative reality where teachers are nice, kids are allowed to read banned books, and the cafeteria food doesn't smell like dirty diapers. Even worse, they've discovered alternative versions of themselves - Evil George and Evil Harold - who plan to unleash some preposterous plans on Piqua, Ohio. Now, it's up to George and Harold to defeat the evil twins and their superhero, Captain Blunderpants.DAV PILKEYDavid Murray "Dav" Pilkey Jr. is an American cartoonist, author, and illustrator of children's literature.
