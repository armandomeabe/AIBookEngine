face2face Second edition is the flexible, easy-to-teach, 6-level course (A1  to C1) for busy teachers who want to get their adult and young adult  learners to communicate with confidence. face2face is informed by Cambridge  English Corpus and its vocabulary syllabus has been mapped to the English  Vocabulary Profile, meaning students learn the language they really need at  each CEFR level. The course improves students' listening skills by drawing  their attention to the elements of spoken English that are difficult to  understand.    The Intermediate Class Audio CDs include complete recordings for the  listening activities in the Student's Book.
