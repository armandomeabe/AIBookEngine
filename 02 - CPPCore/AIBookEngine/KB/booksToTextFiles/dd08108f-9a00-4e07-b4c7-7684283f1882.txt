American MORE! is a four-level course from a highly respected author team  that's bursting with features for lower secondary students. Key language for  each unit is introduced in a photostory and put to use through the 'Language  Focus'. There is thorough coverage of grammar via a dedicated section in  each unit. The 'Learn MORE through English' pages introduce cross-curricular  learning (CLIL) while the 'Learn MORE about Culture' sections explore  English speaking countries. Students learn to 'Read MORE for pleasure' with  the extra reading pages and the CD-ROM enables students to practise  vocabulary, grammar and skills.    The Combo contains half of the material from the regular Student's Book and  Workbook providing 40-45 hours of class material.
