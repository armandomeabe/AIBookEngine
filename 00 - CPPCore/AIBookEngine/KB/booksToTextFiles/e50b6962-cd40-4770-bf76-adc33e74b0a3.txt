ALMA AND HOW SHE GOT HER NAME (HB)"A beautifully illustrated, tender story to be shared with all children, sure to evoke conversations about their names." -School Library Journal (starred review)If you ask her, Alma Sofia Esperanza José Pura Candela has way too many names: six! How did such a small person wind up with such a large name? Alma turns to Daddy for an answer and learns of Sofia, the grandmother who loved books and flowers; Esperanza, the great-grandmother who longed to travel; José, the grandfather who was an artist; and other namesakes, too. As she hears the story of her name, Alma starts to think it might be a perfect fit after all-and realizes that she will one day have her own story to tell. In her 2019 Caldecott Honor Book, Juana Martinez-Neal opens a treasure box of discovery for children who may be curious about their own origin stories or names.JUANA MARTINEZ-NEALJuana Martinez-Neal grew up and studied painting in Lima, Peru, and now lives with her family in Scottsdale, Arizona. Her children appear in the artwork for "Little Boy Azul," "Twinkle, Twinkle, Small Estrella," and "I See la Luna," and their playfulness inspired many of the antics in the other scenes. This is her first picture book.SINOPSISABOUT ALMA AND HOW SHE GOT HER NAMEA 2019 Caldecott Honor BookEdad recomendada: A partir de 4 años.
