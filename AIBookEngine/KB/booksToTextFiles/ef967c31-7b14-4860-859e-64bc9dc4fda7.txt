With an Introduction and Notes by Peter Preston, University of Nottingham    Illustrations by Hablot K. Browne (Phiz) and George Cruickshank    The Old Curiosity Shop (1840-41), with its combination of the sentimental,  the grotesque and the socially concerned, and its story of pursuit and  courage, which sets the downtrodden and the plucky against the malevolent  and the villainous, was an immediate popular success. Little Nell quickly  became one of Dickens' most celebrated characters, who so captured the  imagination of his readers that while the novel was being serialised, many  of them wrote to him about her fate.
