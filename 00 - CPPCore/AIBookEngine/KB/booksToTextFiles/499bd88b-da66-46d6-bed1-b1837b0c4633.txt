Like every other play in the Cambridge School Shakespeare series, King Henry  V has been specially prepared to help all students in schools and colleges.  This version of Henry V aims to be different from other editions of the  play. It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through  enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are  encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone  else's interpretation handed down to you. Whatever you do, remember that  Shakespeare wrote his plays to be acted, watched and enjoyed.
