Up-to-date resources providing full coverage of Cambridge IGCSEÂ® First Language English (0500 and 0522) for first examination in 2015. This updated, write-in Workbook can be used for independent learning, for homework tasks or revision. It contains text extracts from around the world with linked exercises for students to practise the skills they need for the Cambridge IGCSE. Exercises are grouped into 12 diverse units on cross-curricula topics which are not linked to the Coursebook themes, so students remain engaged in the reading material. The Workbook has been completely updated in line with the new syllabus. It is particularly suitable for students who need additional support with language and grammar. A microsite provides free online resources to support the course.
