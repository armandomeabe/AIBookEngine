The three stories in this book are about ordinary people, people like you and me; but they find themselves in surprising situations.Lord Arthur Savile, a rich man with no enemies, finds out that he must do something terrible before he can marry. Poor young Hughie Erskine gives money to an old beggar - but the beggar is not what he seems. And Lord Murchison falls in love with a mystery woman - but what is the strange secret behind the door in Cumnor Street?
