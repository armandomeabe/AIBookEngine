Simple and ingenious, Pop Out Stencils: Farm Animals shows you how to make amazing pictures, bunting, puppets, cards, mobiles and much more. Stencilling is the perfect way to engage the imagination; these animal stencil shapes will inspire young creatives to experiment and become confident in their drawing abilities. They'll be encouraged to choose paints, coloured pencils, crayons, felt tips, or chalk; and brushing, stippling, dabbing, or sponging to create different effects. They will enjoy hours of satisfying, absorbing activity and experience the true pleasure of making art. Each spread has three different sizes of pop-out stencils and three creative ways to use them. The stencils can be used time and again, and stored in their nested shapes inside the book.
