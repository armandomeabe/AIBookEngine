Ty Perry's second-grade life is crazier than ever.     He's trying hard not to worry too much, but that's not easy when his brain  is filled with so many thoughts, like finally finding a pet for Baby Maggie,  his sometimes-crazy classmates, and the dreaded neck-pinch-of-death. And  then there's his upcoming recitation about doing an act of kindness in front  of the whole class!     Ty remains his wacky, curious self in this bighearted second installment of  the Life of Ty series. Practicing kindness, random or not, doesn't take that  much worrying after all. Being kind is part of being Ty.
