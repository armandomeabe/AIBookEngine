The Teacher's Book contains all the material included in the Student's Book  with interleaved Teacher's Notes. The notes are organised in the form of  suggested lesson plans and the functions, structures and vocabulary  introduced in each lesson are categorised and presented at the beginning of  each lesson. This kind of organisation aims at making teaching more  effective. The notes also contain the answers to all exercises, useful tips  necessary for the development of all four skills, background notes and  information on related weblinks, the transcripts for the listening exercises  and creative ideas for optional activities.
