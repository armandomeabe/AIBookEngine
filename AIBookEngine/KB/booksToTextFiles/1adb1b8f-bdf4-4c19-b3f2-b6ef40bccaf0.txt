In the history of the United States, only four active federal judges have  been murdered. Judge Raymond Fawcett has just become number five. His body  is found in his remote lakeside cabin. There is no sign of forced entry or  struggle. Just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And  one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.     One man, a former attorney, knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and why. But  that man, Malcolm Bannister, is currently residing in the Federal Prison  Camp near Frostburg, Maryland. Though serving time, Malcolm has an ace up  his sleeve. He has information the FBI would love to know. Malcolm would  love to tell them. But everything has a price-and the man known as the  Racketeer wasn't born yesterday.
