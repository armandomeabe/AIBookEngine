I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST'A soft, sweet, and incredibly important story about a nonbinary teen finding their voice. This book is going to be so important to so many people.' - Alice Oseman, author of HeartstopperIt's just three words: I am nonbinary. But that's all it takes to change everything.When Ben De Backer comes out as nonbinary, it doesn't go down as planned: they are thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister.All Ben can do is try to keep a low profile in a new school. But Ben's attempts to go unnoticed are thwarted when Nathan Allan, a funny and charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wing.As Ben and Nathan's friendship grows, their feelings begin to change, and what started as a disastrous turn of events looks like it might just be a chance to start a happier, new life.At turns heartbreaking and joyous, I Wish You All the Best by Mason Deaver is both a celebration of life, friendship, and love, and a shining example of hope in the face of adversity.'Heartfelt, romantic, and quietly groundbreaking. This book will save lives.' - Becky Albertalli, author of Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens AgendaMASON DEAVERBorn and raised in a small town in North Carolina, Mason Deaver is an award-nominated, bestselling author and designer living in Charlotte.
