A funny football story by Malachy Doyle and Garry Parsons. Seamus loves two things - United and ghosts! So when he hears that the spooky old castle on the hill has ghosts playing football in it, he's up there in a flash! Well, as quickly as he can go with his scaredy-ba Granda in tow. Once they get into the castle, Seamus discovers that there are two teams kicking a ball around there - the 1948 United and Rovers cup final teams, doomed to play on until they hear the final whistle. And guess what Seamus has in his pocket? But first, there's the chance to beat the Rovers, with Seamus the star striker in place!
