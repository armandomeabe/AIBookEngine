BLOB FISHA heartfelt and humorous adventure from the bottom of the sea and beyond, following one fish on an epic journey.Deep, deep, deep under the sea … lives Blobfish! Blobfish loves telling jokes, although he has no one to share them with, so he sets off on an adventure to find a friend. But sometimes friends turn up in the most unexpected places, even at the bottom of the ocean. This heartfelt and humorous story gently introduces children to themes of friendship, belonging and the issue of plastics in our oceans.OLAF FALAFELOlaf Falafel is an author, illustrator and a stand-up comedian (which is pretty similar to a stand-up chameleon except he doesn't change colour to blend in with the background). He's the holder of The Funniest Joke of the Edinburgh Fringe and has created and performed several stupidly named comedy shows including Olaf Falafel and the Cheese of Truth. As well as trying to make people laugh on stage, Olaf draws a lot and tries to come up with funny ideas for kids' books. He also has an Art Club on YouTube full of real drawing tips and facts about famous artists. Olaf loves visiting schools too, in 2019 he went to 100 schools in 100 days - when he was done, he put his feet up and had a well earned cup of tea!Edad recomendada: a partir de 3 años
