NOW A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     With a career, a boyfriend, and a loving family, Piper Kerman barely  resembles the reckless young woman who delivered a suitcase of drug money  ten years before. But that past has caught up with her. Convicted and  sentenced to fifteen months at the infamous federal correctional facility in  Danbury, Connecticut, the well-heeled Smith College alumna is now inmate  #11187-424-one of the millions of people who disappear "down the rabbit  hole" of the American penal system. From her first strip search to her final  release, Kerman learns to navigate this strange world with its strictly  enforced codes of behavior and arbitrary rules. She meets women from all  walks of life, who surprise her with small tokens of generosity, hard words  of wisdom, and simple acts of acceptance. Heartbreaking, hilarious, and at  times enraging, Kerman's story offers a rare look into the lives of women in  prison-why it is we lock so many away and what happens to them when they're  there.     Praise for Orange Is the New Black     "Fascinating . . . The true subject of this unforgettable book is female  bonding and the ties that even bars can't unbind."-People (four stars)      "I loved this book. It's a story rich with humor, pathos, and redemption.  What I did not expect from this memoir was the affection, compassion, and  even reverence that Piper Kerman demonstrates for all the women she  encountered while she was locked away in jail. I will never forget  it."-Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love     "This book is impossible to put down because [Kerman] could be you. Or your  best friend. Or your daughter."-Los Angeles Times     "Moving . . . transcends the memoir genre's usual self-centeredness to  explore how human beings can always surprise you."-USA Today     "It's a compelling awakening, and a harrowing one-both for the reader and  for Kerman."-Newsweek.com
