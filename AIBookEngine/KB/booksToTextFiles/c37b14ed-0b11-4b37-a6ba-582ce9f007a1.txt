CANTERBURY TALES - ENRICHED CLASSICSOn a spring day in April--sometime in the waning years of the 14th  century--29 travelers set out for Canterbury on a pilgrimage to the shrine  of Saint Thomas Beckett. Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a  plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath.  Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of  pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the  spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still  reading Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. If you haven't yet made the  acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never  learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the Tales has been  translated into modern idiom.
