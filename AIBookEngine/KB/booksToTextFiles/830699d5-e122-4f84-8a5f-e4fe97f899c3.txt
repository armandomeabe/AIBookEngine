When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young  entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful,  brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to  realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is  desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana's quiet beauty, wit, and  independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too-but on his own terms.     Shocked yet thrilled by Grey's singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For  all the trappings of success-his multinational businesses, his vast wealth,  his loving family-Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need  to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical  affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey's secrets and explores her own dark  desires.
