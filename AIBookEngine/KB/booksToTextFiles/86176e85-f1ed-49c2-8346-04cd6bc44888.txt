Believe  By Victoria Alexander     All she had to do was believe. . .    Tessa St. James thinks that true love is nothing more than a fairy tale, and  she is absolutely certain she will never encounter someone worthy of her  attention . . . until she meets her knight in shining armor.     His eyes are blue, the set of his chin is defiant, and he carries himself  with unquestioned confidence. And when he kisses her, he sends a wicked  desire through her body. Tessa, the beautiful skeptic, has no choice but to  join forces with this man. Together they begin a quest that might restore  her faith in the power of love . . . even if it costs both their lives.    And happily ever after could only be the stuff of fairy tales after all.
