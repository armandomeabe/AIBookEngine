A ROOM OF ONE'S OWNA Room of One's Own is one of Virginia Woolf's most influential works and widely recognized for its extraordinary contribution to the women's movement. The work was ranked by The Guardian newspaper as number 45 in the 100 World's Best Non-fiction Books.In this extraordinary essay, Virginia Woolf examines the limitations of womanhood in the early twentieth century. With the startling prose and poetic licence of a novelist, she makes a bid for freedom, emphasizing that the lack of an independent income, and the titular room of one´s own, prevents most women from reaching their full literary potential. As relevant in its insight and indignation today as it was when first delivered in those hallowed lecture theatres, A Room of One´s Own remains both a beautiful work of literature and an incisive analysis of women and their place in the world.VIRGINIA WOOLFAdeline Virginia Woolf (25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941) was an English writer.
