Champions Second Edition builds on the tried and test formula of the first  edition with more emphasis on developing students' confidence in real life  situations. Language is presented in context at the start of every unit in a  photo-story in the lower levels and in an interesting, teen-appropriate text  in higher levels.    Reading texts in the combined Student Book and Workbook and the graded  reader that accompanies each level of Champions Second Edition develop  students' reading skills and consolidate the language.
