Mums are UNIQUE.They can play let's pretend . . .. . . and be your best friend.They can be pilots of planesOr drivers of trains.All mums are DIFFERENT, MAGIC . . . and MAGNIFICENT!Mums Are Magnificent champions the diverse nature of mums and uplifts and celebrates ALL types of mums everywhere - the perfect present to mark the arrival of a new baby or to give to that very special mum on Mother's Day.
