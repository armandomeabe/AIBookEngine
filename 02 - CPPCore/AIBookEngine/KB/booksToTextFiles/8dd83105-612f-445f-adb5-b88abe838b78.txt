A landmark in American fiction, this epic novel, one of its masterpieces,  explores Faulkner's central theme, the nature of evil.   Joe Christmas - a man doomed, deracinated and alone - wanders the Deep South  in search of an identity, and a place in society. After killing his  perverted God-fearing lover, he is pursued by a lynch-hungry mob. Yet after  the sacrifice, there is new life, a determined ray of light in Faulkner's  complex and tragic world.
