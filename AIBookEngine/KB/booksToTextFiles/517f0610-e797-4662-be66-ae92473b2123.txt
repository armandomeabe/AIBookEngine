I'M STILL UP! A soothing and humorous bedtime story with a baby who is still up! This is the ideal board book for baby to read before lying down to sleep.The sun is DOWN but the moon is UP, and so is the baby! They are not sleepy...not at all.Perfect for babies and their loved ones, I'm Still Up! is a joyful story about the age-old struggle of bed time, and a soothing reminder that when Mommy and Daddy, the cat and the dog and even the sun are sleepy, baby might be, too. By repeating shapes, words, and language, I'm Still Up! will help your baby learn new words and routines while you read a bedtime story.Sweet, humorous, and adorable, Antoinette Portis's illustrations and simple text are perfect for fans of the Sheep in a Jeep and Llama Llama series, and Leslie Patricelli's board books.Edad recomendada: De 0 a 3 a√±os.
