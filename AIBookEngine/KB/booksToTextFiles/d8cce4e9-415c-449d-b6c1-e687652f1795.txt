With faith inthemselves and in each other, they seek a new beginning among the exiledScottish Highlanders of the Cape Fear, in the fertile river valleys of theColony of North Carolina.Even in the New World, though, the Frasers find their hope of peace threatenedfrom without and within; by the British Crown and by Jamie's aunt, JocastaMacKenzie, last of the MacKenzies of Leoch.A hunger for freedom drives Jamie to a Highlander's only true refuge: themountains.
