**WINNER of the Sainsbury's Children's Book Awards 2020***Mabel may be a small fly but she has Big Plans...1. Climb a mountain2. Host a dinner party3. Make friends with a sharkMabel's friends aren't being very helpful, but Mabel knows the truth about Big Plans:*Don't listen to those who say you cannot. Listen to those who say you can!*So, even though a mountain is very, very high and Mabel is very, very small she knows she shouldn't give up. And even though it might have been easier to fly up a tree, Mabel knows that she needs to keep going and climb!Mabel is the best little fly to show readers big and small that there is nothing more important than the power of confidence, and believing in yourself!Also available from Kim Hillyard:Ned and the Great Garden Hamster Race: a story about kindness
