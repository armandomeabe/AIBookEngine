ONLY A TREE, KNOWS HOW TO BE A TREE - 978-1-5362-1470-3Edad recomendada: A partir de 6 a√±os.SINOPSISAll living creatures have a special place in the world in this extraordinary exploration of the concept of self for very young readers.Only I know how to be me.Only you know how to be you.Trees have leaves that turn sunshine into food. Amazing! Birds build nests, sing songs, hatch eggs, and fly. Dogs are our friends and can move their ears to tell us how they feel, while fish live in water, flashing like jewels. As for people, every person on Earth is different, each with their own thoughts and feelings. With a simple narrative and joyful, welcoming illustrations celebrating a world full of remarkable creatures, Mary Murphy reminds little ones that we are all unique, and that we are the only ones who know how to be us.
