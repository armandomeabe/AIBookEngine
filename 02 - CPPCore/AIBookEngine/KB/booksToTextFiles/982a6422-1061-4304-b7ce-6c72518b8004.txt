THE DREAMERWinner of the 2011 Pura Belpré Award for fiction-now in an elegant paperback  edition!  From the time he is a young boy, Neftali hears the call of a mysterious  voice. He knows he must follow it-even when the neighborhood children taunt  him, and when his harsh, authoritarian father ridicules him, and when he  doubts himself. It leads him under the canopy of the lush rain forest, into  the fearsome sea, and through the persistent Chilean rain, until finally, he  discovers its source.    Combining elements of magical realism with biography, poetry, literary  fiction, and sensorial, transporting illustrations, Pam Muñoz Ryan and Peter  Sís take readers on a rare journey of the heart and imagination.Edad recomendada: A partir de 10 años.
