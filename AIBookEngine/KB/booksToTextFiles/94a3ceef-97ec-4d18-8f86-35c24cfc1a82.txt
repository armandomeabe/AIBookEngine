Winnie's best friend, Iggie, has just moved away - and Winnie's bored out of her mind without her. So she's determined to be friends with the new family, the Garbers, who've moved into Winnie's old house - especially Glenn, who's kind of cute. But certain people don't want the Garbers to be there, and have started a petition to get rid of them. You see Glenn and his family are black, and Grove Street is stuck in the past. And the toughest thing of all is that Winnie's terrified her parents might sign the petition - and there's nothing she can do to stop them. Iggie's House is a moving novel that tackles neighbourhood prejudice, from celebrated children's author, Judy Blume.
