The life story of Isabel Allende - one of the world's favourite writers - is  as exotic, passionate and inspiring as one of her novels.    'The biggest straitjacket is all the prejudices that we carry around, and  all the fears. But what if we just surrender to the fear? There are things  greater than fear. The great, wonderful quality of human beings is that we  can overcome even absolute terror, and we do.'    Just three when her parents divorced, Isabel Allende was raised in her  grandparents' home in Chile. She left school at 16 and married Miguel Fr as  at 19. She then juggled her work as a journalist, editor, advice columnist  and television interviewer with looking after her two children.
