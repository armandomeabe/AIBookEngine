Primary Readers are aimed at young learners of English. These charming short stories make reading both pleasurable and educational. All titles are available in British and American editions.The stories have been carefully graded for six levels and make use of basic grammatical structures and vocabulary. Glossy, detailed illustrations on each page help to stimulate learners and facilitate understanding. Each Primary Reader is divided into four-page sections and each section is followed by two Activity Pages.
