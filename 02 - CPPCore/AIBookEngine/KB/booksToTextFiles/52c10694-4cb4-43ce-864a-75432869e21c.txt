Filled with questions, challenges, creative prompts and fun surveys One for Me, One for You is a new and innovative take on the 'All About Me' genre. Inside the vinyl jacket, readers will find two postcard-shaped books with stunning glitter covers. The books contain the same content but with their own individual design touches. The first book is just for you, while the second book can be completed by one friend - or many. Together, the books become a unique record of how similar, different and special friends are!
