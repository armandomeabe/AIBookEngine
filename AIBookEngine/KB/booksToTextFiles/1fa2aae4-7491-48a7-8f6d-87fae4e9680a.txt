LONG WAY HOME - 978-1-4052-2669-1Age: 13 years.MICHAEL MORPURGOI was born a really long time ago. 5th October 1943. In St Alban's in Hertfordshire. My mother was there too, strangely enough, but my father was away at the war, in Baghdad. I had one older brother, Pieter. We both were evacuated to Northumberland when we were little, away from the bombs. After the war it was all change at home, not that I remember much of it. My mother wanted to be with a man she had met while my father was away in the army. He was called Jack Morpurgo. So my father came home to find there was no place for him. There was a divorce. Jack Morpurgo married my mother, and so became our stepfather.SYNOPSISLong Way Home is a heartfelt tale of an orphaned boy in search of family from War Horse author and former Children's Laureate, Michael Morpurgo.Another summer.
