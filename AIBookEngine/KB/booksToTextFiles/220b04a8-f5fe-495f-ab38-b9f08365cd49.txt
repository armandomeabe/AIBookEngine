The diverse tales selected for this volume display the astonishing  virtuosity of Rudyard Kipling's early writings. A Nobel prize-winner,  Kipling was phenomenally productive and imaginative, displaying a literary  mastery of idioms, technology and technical terms, exotic locations, and  social range. He gained immense popularity, becoming (as these stories  indicate) the knowledgeable spokesman for a wide public.    Later, although Kipling's right-wing views increasingly incurred hostility,  his creativity remained formidable. In this rich collection, we encounter  bold realism, poignant nostalgia, dark comedy, the vividly horrific, the  exuberantly fanciful and the disturbingly uncanny.
