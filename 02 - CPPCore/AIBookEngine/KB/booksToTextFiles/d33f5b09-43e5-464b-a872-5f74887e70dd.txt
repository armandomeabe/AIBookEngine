In The Body Artist, Don DeLillo sacrifices breadth for depth, narrowing his  focus to a single life, a single death. The protagonist is Lauren Hartke,  who we see sharing breakfast with her husband, Rey, in the opening pages.  This 18-page sequence is a tour de force (albeit a less showy one than the  author's initial salvo in Underworld)--an intricate, funny notation of  Lauren's consciousness as she pours cereal, peers out the window and makes  idle chat. Rey, alas, will proceed directly from the breakfast table to the  home of his former wife, where he'll unceremoniously blow his brains out.
