Objective PET provides exam preparation and practice for the PET exam. The  Objective PET for Schools Practice Test Booklet without answers provides two  practice tests for Cambridge ESOL's new PET for Schools exam launched in  March 2009. It may be used in conjunction with Objective PET or any other  PET-level course in order to familiarise students with the test format and  content.
