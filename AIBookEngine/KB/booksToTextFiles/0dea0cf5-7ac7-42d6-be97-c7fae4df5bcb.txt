Did you feel scared on your first day of school? Have you ever felt nervous talking in class? How did you feel? Did your heart beat really fast? Read about Omar Chole, and what they did when they felt scared.Each book focuses on a different emotion, looking at why children may feel a certain way and how they can deal with their feelings.Every title features two stories, each told from a child's point of view, which involve common scenarios or situations. For example, the main characters interact with each other through the series, sharing experiences that readers can easily relate too.These sensitive stories reassure young readers and provide them with a vocabulary which helps them to express and understand their feelings as they grow up and encounter different situations. 'Story words' in each book explain words simply and gently.Beautiful, fun illustrations from an award winning illustrator, plus supporting text for parents and teachers ensure children get the most from the books.
