Richards explains how effective language teaching involves a network of  interactions between curriculum, methodology, teachers, learners,  instructional materials. Each chapter discusses and examines the theoretical  and practical dimensions of a central issue in language teaching. Topics  covered include the nature of effective teaching, self-monitoring in teacher  development, language and content, and teaching listening, speaking, reading  and writing. Richards presents key issues in an accessible and highly  readable style, and shows how teachers and teachers-in-training can be  involved in the investigation of classroom teaching and learning. The  emphasis is not on prescriptions but rather on developing effective teaching  through understanding the various factors that interact in second language  learning and in the second language classroom.
