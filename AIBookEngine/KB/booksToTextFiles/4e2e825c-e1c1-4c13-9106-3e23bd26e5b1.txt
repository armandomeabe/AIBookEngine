I live on chilly ice and have fluffy white fur. Can you guess who I am? By lifting the flap the answer is revealed! Guess Who's in the Snow introduces young children to some of their favourite animals from snowy habitat. With eight lift-and-look flaps, this book is perfect for little hands! Each book encourages children to work out who each animal is, with the help of written questions and clues, and visual hints such as a furry pattern peeking out from behind a bush. There are three clue questions to answer on each spread, as well as animal noises to imitate, things to spot and an extra animal fact under each flap. Each book has two review spreads with additional activities and discussion points.
