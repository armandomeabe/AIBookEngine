AGNES GREY - 978-987-4886-90-3Edad recomendada: AdultosANNE BRONTEShe was born in 1820 in the town of Thornton, Yorkshire. Anne was the youngest of six brothers and sisters. Like her two sisters, Emily Brontë and Charlotte Brontë, she was the author of Victorian-era romance novels. Due to her delicate health, she was raised and educated at home, although she briefly attended an English school. She worked as a governess for some families, and the experiences of her first job and its circumstances were incorporated into her first novel, Agnes Gray. Both her novels and her poems were published under the pseudonym Acton Bell, in order to break down the barriers against publishing as a woman.SINOPSISThe well-educated daughter of a penniless clergyman, Agnes Grey is treated like a child by her family and so she sets out to prove herself by seeking employment as a governess. Soon, however, her idealistic notions regarding the education and care of her wards are dashed as she battles to control the wild Bloomfield children; eventually she is relieved of her duties. Then, she starts working for the Murray household; even though her position is slightly better than the previous one, she is held in low regard by the Murrays. This is a deeply personal novel written from the author's own experience, dealing with themes such as the nature of childhood, the rise of the middle classes and the loneliness, cruelty, and even ill-treatment that life as a governess could entail. Agnes Grey is full of quiet passion and remains a beloved classic up to this day.
