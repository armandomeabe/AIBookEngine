Mob-connected loan shark Chili Palmer is sick of the Miami grind-plus his  "friends" have a bad habit of dying there. So when he chases a deadbeat  client out to Hollywood, Chili figures he might like to stay. This town,  with its dream-makers, glitter, hucksters, and liars-plus gorgeous,  partially clad would-be starlets everywhere you look-seems ideal for an  enterprising criminal with a taste for the cinematic. Besides, Chili's got  an idea for a killer movie, though it could very possibly kill him to get it  made.
