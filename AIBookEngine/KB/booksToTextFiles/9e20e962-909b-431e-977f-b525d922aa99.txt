This book brings together the work of 15 elementary education experts who  support an integrative approach to educating second language children, one  that goes beyond language teaching methodology to cover a wide range of  issues affecting the academic and social success of language minority  children. The volume deals not only with language development, but with the  development of the whole child; rather than focusing on language  instruction, it addresses the entire curriculum; and instead of limiting  itself to classroom learning, it examines the role of the school, family,  and community. This new perspective is developed through research-based  articles, written in a style accessible to a wide audience of teaching  professionals.
