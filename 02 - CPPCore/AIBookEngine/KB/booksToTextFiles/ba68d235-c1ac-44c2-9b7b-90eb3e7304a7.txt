This series of delightful storybooks is a flexible resource designed to help teachers engage and motivate young learners in the classroom. They are an ideal way to support children in the early stages of learning English. Teacher's Books and Audio Cassettes/CDs make the Storybooks simple to use: the Teacher's Books cover the entire level and include step-by-step teaching notes with ideas for classes of different ability, photocopiable worksheets, and 'If you have time' sections suggesting original ideas for games and activities. The Audio Cassettes/CDs feature all the titles in each level read aloud, exposing children to different voices while they have fun listening to the dramatisations. At levels 3 and 4 selected titles are designed to be read as a play. Watch your pupils' confidence in English grow as they act out the stories together!
