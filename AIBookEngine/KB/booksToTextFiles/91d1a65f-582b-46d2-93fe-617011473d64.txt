ASSESSING VOCABULARY    This volume presents a framework that expands the traditional concept of a  vocabulary test to cover a range of procedures for assessing the vocabulary  knowledge of second language learners.    Reviews  'This is a weighty book in a weighty series: the authoritative Cambridge  Language Assessment series.' EL Gazette, 2001    'The book's great strength must lie in the competence with which it  summarises research into vocabulary acquisition and research. Read's book is  both timely and well-designed, and provides an accessible framework for  discussion of aspects of vocabulary knowledge.' ELT Journal
