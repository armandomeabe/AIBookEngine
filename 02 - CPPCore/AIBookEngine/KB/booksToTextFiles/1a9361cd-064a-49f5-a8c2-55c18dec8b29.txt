When Thomas's wish is magically granted, he can fly! But it's not a soaraway success...  A brilliant story from award-winning author Sally Gardner, in her MAGICAL CHILDREN series.One day a fairy turns up at Thomas Top's house to grant him a birthday wish. Thomas wishes he could fly and soon goes from being just an ordinary boy whom no one notices to being the most popular boy in the school. But his flying gets him suspended from school, and that makes his dad so cross and his mum miserable. Then the fairy turns up again and, with help from her and Thomas's new friend Mr Vinnie, a retired painter and decorator who has been flying since he was Thomas's age, everything changes.An enchanting story about growing in confidence and using your gifts.
