Over the last 20 years vocabulary research has grown from a Cinderella  subject to a position of some importance. Vocabulary is now considered  integral to just about every aspect of language knowledge and is a lively  and vital area of research and innovation. With this development have come  standard and widely-used tests, such as vocabulary size and lexical richness  measures, and commonly accepted metaphors, such as the mental lexicon as a  web of words. Less widely known outside academic circles, however, is the  extensive work on learners' lexis and the utility, reliability and validity  of the tests we use to measure and investigate it.    This volume brings together contributions from internationally-renowned  researchers in this field to explain much of the background to study in this  area. It introduces to a wider audience the concerns, the newest approaches  and developments in the field of vocabulary research and testing.
