Product Description  What will we do when there is nowhere to put our rubbish? Every day, all  over the world, people drop cans, boxes, paper, and bottles into bins and  never think about them again. And the rubbish mountains get bigger and  bigger. But there is another way - a way that makes old paper into houses,  broken bottles into jewellery, and old cans into bridges. Anyone can recycle  - it's easy, it saves money, and it's a way to say, 'I care about the  Earth.' Saving the world starts with you - here - now.
