ESSENTIALISM - THE DISCIPLINED PURSUIT OF LESSThe life-changing international bestseller that started a global movement - now updated with the new 21-Day Essentialism Challenge and an exclusive excerpt from EFFORTLESSHave you ever found yourself struggling with information overload?Have you ever felt both overworked and underutilised?Do you ever feel busy but not productive?If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is to become an Essentialist.In Essentialism, Greg McKeown, CEO of a Leadership and Strategy agency in Silicon Valley who has run courses at Apple, Google and Facebook, shows you how to achieve what he calls the disciplined pursuit of less. Being an Essentialist is about a disciplined way of thinking. It means challenging the core assumption of 'We can have it all' and 'I have to do everything' and replacing it with the pursuit of 'the right thing, in the right way, at the right time'.By applying a more selective criteria for what is essential, the pursuit of less allows us to regain control of our own choices so we can channel our time, energy and effort into making the highest possible contribution toward the goals and activities that matter.Using the experience and insight of working with the leaders of the most innovative companies and organisations in the world, McKeown shows you how to put Essentialism into practice in your own life, so you too can achieve something great.ReviewsIncredibly helpful â€¦ one of the few books that I revisit on a regular basisTim FerrissGREG MCKEOWN Greg McKeown was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.
