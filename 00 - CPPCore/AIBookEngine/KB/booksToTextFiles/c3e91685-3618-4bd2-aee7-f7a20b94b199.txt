PIG-HEART BOYA powerful story about friendship, loyalty and family around this topical and controversial issue' - Guardian'An engrossing story' - Daily Telegraph'That's all I ever did - watch and listen. I was always a spectator, never a participant. I didn't call that living. I was alive - but that was all.'Cameron is thirteen, and all he wants is a 'normal' life - friends, swimming, school, family.But his life is far from normal. Not every thirteen-year-old desperately needs a new heart because theirs doesn't work properly.Finally, one doctor offers hope.Cameron could - if he and his parents agree - take part in a radical and controversial procedure involving the transplant of a pig's heart into his human body.It's risky. And it's never been done before . . .While Cameron comes to terms with the idea, he finds the world around him is much less accepting.But surely everyone will understand that it's better to have a pig's heart that works than a human heart that doesn't - won't they . . .?'A sensitive and informative story that provides a vivid insight into transgenics and xenotransplantations and still manages to squeeze in the inevitable guinea-pig and piggy in the middle jokes' - IndependentMALORIE BLACKMANMalorie Blackman has written over seventy books for children and young adults, including the Noughts & Crosses series, Thief and a science-fiction thriller, Chasing the Stars.
