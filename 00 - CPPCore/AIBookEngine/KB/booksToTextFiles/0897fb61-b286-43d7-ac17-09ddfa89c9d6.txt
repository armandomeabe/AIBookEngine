A groundbreaking course, which combines ELT methodologies with games-based  learning to yield ambitious learning outcomes and to offer solid preparation  for Cambridge Young Learners English Testing (CYLET), KET and Trinity Exams.    Learners go on fascinating quests, follow clues, and sing and interact with  quirky and funky Poptropican characters in a safe and unique virtual world.  Islands offers a streamlined and gently paced syllabus with lots of  recycling.  The Activity Book provides reinforcement and consolidation of the language  presented in the Pupil's Book. It is organised as follows: * A Welcome unit  of four lessons, for use after the corresponding Pupil's Book pages. *Eight  units divided into ten lessons (as in the Pupil's Book). * A Goodbye unit of  four lessons (as in the Pupil's Book). *Eight festival lessons at the back  of the book for use at Bonfire Night, Christmas, Easter and Wimbledon. *Unit  review activities. These are linked to corresponding grammar points in the  Pupil's Book. * A Picture Dictionary at the back of the book to help pupils  to review and remember the target language.
