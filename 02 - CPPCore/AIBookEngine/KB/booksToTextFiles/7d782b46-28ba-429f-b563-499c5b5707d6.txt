Can true love be built on lies? A teen on the run seeks relief and  redemption in this gripping, romantic read.    Leah Kurtz has finally found a place to call home, a town where she and baby  Addy can live in peace, far from the drug-infested place she grew up. Chris  is one of the best parts of her new life, the only person who's ever made  her feel safe. And now that she's found him, there's no way she can tell the  truth:    Her real name is Faith, not Leah. She's seventeen, not nineteen. And the  baby isn't hers-Faith kidnapped her.    Faith's history catches up with her when a cop starts asking questions and  Chris's aunt spots her picture in the newspaper. She knows it's time to run  again, but if Faith leaves, she'll lose Chris. If Chris is in love with a  lie, though, did Faith ever really have him in the first place?
