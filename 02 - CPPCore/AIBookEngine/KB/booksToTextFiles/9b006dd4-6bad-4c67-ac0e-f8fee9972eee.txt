THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST - INTERACT WITH LITERATURE (B2/C1)'To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.'Ever since its debut on February 14th, 1895, The Importance of Being Earnest has been a literary and theatrical success. The brilliance of the witty conversation never ceases to delight and entertain. However, beneath its dazzling ironic humour, there is a deep vein of social criticism of Victorian society. This intricate mix of comedy, absurdity, ambiguity and social criticism makes The Importance of Being Earnest Oscar Wilde's masterpiece.Author Oscar WildeLanguage ENGLISHCategory	LiteratureSeries Interact with LiteratureGenre Humour & ComedyLevel B2/C1Examinations First and above, Preliminary
