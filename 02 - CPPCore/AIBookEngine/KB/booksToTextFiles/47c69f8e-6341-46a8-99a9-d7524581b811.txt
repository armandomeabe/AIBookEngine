Kent Rasmussen and a foreword by Azar Nafisi, author of Reading Lolita in Tehran and The Republic of ImaginationIn recent years, neither the persistent effort to "clean up" the racial epithets in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn nor its consistent use in the classroom have diminished, highlighting the novel's wide-ranging influence and its continued importance in American society. An incomparable adventure story, it is a vignette of a turbulent, yet hopeful epoch in American history, defining the experience of a nation in voices often satirical, but always authentic.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
