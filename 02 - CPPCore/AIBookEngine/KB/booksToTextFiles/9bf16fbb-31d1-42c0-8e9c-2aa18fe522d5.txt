Pretty soon, events are set in motion that will take Johnny - and Kaspar -  all around the world, surviving theft, shipwreck and rooftop rescues along  the way. Because everything changes with a cat like Kaspar around. After  all, he's Prince Kaspar Kandinsky, Prince of Cats, a Muscovite, a Londoner  and a New Yorker, and as far as anyone knows, the only cat to survive the  sinking of the Titanic!
