Walk around any famous city and layers of history start to emerge. In London, Roman walls stand shoulder to shoulder with modern architecture. In Rome, ancient treasures like the Colosseum stand shoulder to shoulder with buildings from the Renaissance. In New York, skyscrapers from the 1920s and 1930s have been upstaged by enormous glass towers.In Cities in Layers, six famous world cities will be shown at different stages of their history. A clever die-cut element allows readers to really feel like they are peeling back time.
