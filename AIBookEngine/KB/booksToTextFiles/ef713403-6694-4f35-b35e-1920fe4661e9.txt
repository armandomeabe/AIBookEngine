Private goes on the hunt for London's most feared killer since Jack the  Ripper.    For Hannah Shapiro, a young American student, the nightmare began eight  years ago in Los Angeles, when the owner of Private--the world's most  exclusive detective agency--saved her from a horrific death. Now, after  eight years, the terror follows her to London. The only man who can help is  former Royal Military Police Sergeant Dan Carter, head of Private London.    In London, young women are being abducted and their bodies found mutilated  in a grotesque, mysterious way. Carter's ex-wife, DI Kirsty Webb, leads the  investigation into these brutal murders, which may somehow be linked to  Hannah Shapiro.    Working together, the two investigators are caught in a desperate race  against the odds. Private may be the most advanced detection agency in the  world...but can they catch a predator who rivals London's most elusive  killer ever?
