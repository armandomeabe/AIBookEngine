THE MAGICIAN'S ELEPHANT - MOVIE TIE-IN Soon to be streamed on Netflix, this timeless fable evokes the largest of themes - hope and belonging, desire and compassion - with the lightness of a magician's touch.Another classic in the making by Kate DiCamillo, New York Times bestselling author and twice winner of the prestigious Newbery Medal. What if? Why not? Could it be? When a fortune-teller's tent appears in the market square of the city of Baltese, orphan Peter Augustus Duchene knows the questions that he must ask: Does his sister still live? And if so, how can he find her? The fortune-teller's mysterious answer (An elephant! An elephant will lead you there!) sets off a chain of events so remarkable, so impossible, that you will hardly dare to believe it is true. With atmospheric illustrations by fine artist Yoko Tanaka, here is a dreamlike and captivating tale that could only be told by Kate DiCamillo.KATE DI CAMILLOKate studied English at the University of Florida, and then worked on a whole series of very different jobs.

I cleaned bathrooms (I wasn't very good at it) and sold advertising (I was even worse at that)." But all the while Kate she knew that what she really wanted to do was write.Edad recomendada: a partir de 10 a√±os
