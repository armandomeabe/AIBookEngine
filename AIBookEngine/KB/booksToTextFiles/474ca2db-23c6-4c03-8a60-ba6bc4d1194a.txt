Keep it REAL! really is your best option for a modern secondary course for today's teenagers. Students focus on developing communicative competence and 21st century skills, with this flexible blend of dynamic video and digital content, and easy-to-use classroom materials. As students develop their grammar, vocabulary and speaking, we help you manage skills development in mixed ability classes, too. The course also focuses on culture, with optional project-based work, literature lessons and common exam task practice.WorkbookThe Workbook is available in print or digital format, making a flexible blended learning package for learners in and out of the classroom! Both versions give students thorough independent practice of the Student's Book language and skills material, to work on anywhere you or they like, with three-star graded activities for mixed ability. There is a Progress Check every three units, and a Writing Summary section at the back of the book. Students can download the Workbook audio in MP3 format from the RLP, and access the entire e-Workbook with fully-interactive practice activities and skills work.
