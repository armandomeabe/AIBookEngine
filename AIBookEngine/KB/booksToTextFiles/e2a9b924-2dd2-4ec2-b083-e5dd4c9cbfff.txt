Written for students encountering the topic for the first time, this is a  clear and practical introduction to second language acquisition (SLA). It  explains in non-technical language how a second language is acquired; what  the second language learner needs to know; and why some learners are more  successful than others. The textbook introduces in a step-by-step fashion a  range of fundamental concepts - such as SLA in adults and children, in  formal and informal learning contexts, and in diverse socio-cultural  settings - and takes an interdisciplinary approach, encouraging students to  consider SLA from linguistic, psychological and social perspectives. Each  chapter contains a list of key terms, a summary, and a range of graded  exercises suitable for self-testing or class discussion. Providing a solid  foundation in SLA, this book is set to become the leading introduction to  the field for students of linguistics, psychology, and education, and  trainee language teachers.
