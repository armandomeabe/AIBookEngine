Assessing Young Language Learners  View full components listing for Assessing Young Language Learners  Penny McKay  Queensland University of Technology    In this book the author builds a comprehensive framework for the assessment  of young language learners in both foreign language and second language  learning situations. She begins by considering why we need a special book on  young learner assessment, and describes the nature of young learner language  learning. The assessment approach is task-based and is centred around tasks  and techniques suitable for young learners, with particular emphasis on  classroom assessment. Oral language assessment, and reading and writing  assessment are addressed in separate chapters, as is the large-scale testing  of young learners. Underpinned by sound theory, the book is full of  practical guidelines, and draws on examples of assessment contexts, issues  and practices from around the world. Assessing Young Language Learners was  winner of the Kenneth W Mildenberger Prize in 2006.
