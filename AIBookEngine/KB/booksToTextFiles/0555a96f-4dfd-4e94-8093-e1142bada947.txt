STUDENT'S BOOK WITH STUDENT'S APP AND DIGITAL STUDENT'S BOOKIn each unit of the Student's Book teens gather the knowledge, language and skills to be able to answer the WDYT? (What do you think?) question that opens each unit. With this blended version, comprising the print and digital Student's Book as well as the Student's App, switching between online and face-to-face classes is an effortless task.
