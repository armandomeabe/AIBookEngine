Contemporary interior design is largely defined by the creation of diverse spaces that can be experienced with all of the senses. One aspect in this regard is the original use of materials. This also serves as the conceptual base of the two complementary volumes Inside that are part of the series Architecture in Focus. The two books show how varied, and sometimes quite unusual, the range of applications and combination is, done by wellknown and (still) unknown architects, designers and artists. Inside can be used as a real reference guide and a source of ideas: because materiality is the guiding principle of this book, every picture has captions with a detailed listing of the applied materials and design elements. While the sixty projects of this title are all made from the softer, diaphanous materials colour, fabric, glass and light the complementary volume Inside. Interiors of Concrete Stone Wood is devoted to the more classical and durable materials.
