Shelby Foxworth lost her husband. Then she lost her illusions .     The man who took her from Tennessee to an exclusive Philadelphia suburb left  her in crippling debt. He was an adulterer and a liar, and when Shelby  tracks down his safe-deposit box, she finds multiple IDs. The man she loved  wasn't just dead. He never really existed.     Shelby takes her three-year-old daughter and heads south to seek comfort in  her hometown, where she meets someone new: Griff Lott, a successful  contractor. But her husband had secrets she has yet to discover. Even in  this small town, surrounded by loved ones, danger is closer than she  knows-and threatens Griff, as well. And an attempted murder is only the  beginning .
