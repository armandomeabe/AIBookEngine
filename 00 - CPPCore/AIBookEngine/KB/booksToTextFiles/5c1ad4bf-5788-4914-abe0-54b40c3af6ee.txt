Companion to the hit The Three Ninja Pigs, this fractured fairy tale is a  sure-fire storytime hit.    Wolf just can't catch a break! Ever since the three little pigs started  teaching everyone Ninja skills, huffing and puffing just hasn't been enough  to scare up a good meal.     His craving for meat sends Wolf to classes at the dojo, and soon he's ready  to try out his new moves. A little girl and her tiny granny should be easy  targets-right?
