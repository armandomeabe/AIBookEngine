A secure and secluded retreat for the rich and powerful becomes the setting  for an unsettling series of murders.  Combe Island off the Cornish coast is a restful haven for the elite. But  when one of its distinguished visitors is found hanging from the island's  famous lighthouse in what appears to have been a murder, the peace is  shattered. Commander Adam Dalgliesh is called in to handle the sensitive  case, but at a difficult time for him and his depleted team. He is uncertain  about his future with his girlfriend Emma Lavenham; his principle detective  Kate Miskin is going through an emotional crisis; and the ambitious Sergeant  Francis Benton-Smith is not happy about having a female boss. After a second  brutal killing, the whole investigation is jeopardized, and Dalgliesh is  faced with a danger even more insidious than murder.
