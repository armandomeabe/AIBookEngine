Chilean poet Neruda (1904-73), winner of the Nobel prize among other honors  and whose love poems served as the inspiration for the movie Il Postino, was  prolific, and his work took many forms, including the highly political.  Stephen Mitchell, translator and reader, has wisely selected from among the  various odes and love poems for this extremely well-produced audio offering.  "Forgive me, Seagull, I am a poet of reality," he says, after first praising  the bird, then going on to describe its barking, its stealing garbage from  the mouths of other gulls. Luckily for listeners, Neruda's "reality" permits  forays into imagination, such as the baby's foot that thinks it can fly or  the suit that might soon wear thin or might outlive its owner and be used  for burial. No subject in Neruda's hands is unworthy of praise, including  the onion, the artichoke, salt, socks, or the watch on a lover's wrist.  While translations of the poet's work abound in print, and there are tapes  of him reading his own poems, this is only the second tape of translations  available. A true delight; recommended for all libraries. Rochelle Ratner,  formerly with "Soho Weekly News," New York
