This fabulous new picture book is designed to teach children about appropriate behaviour while enjoying a fun, heart-warming story.

The stories are written in clear, simple text, and Stuart Lynch's charming illustrations will keep children engaged and entertained.Included in each book is a spread of information for parents, which includes questions to ask children to engage them more deeply in the topic. It provides parents with an opportunity to build on the issues presented in the book.
