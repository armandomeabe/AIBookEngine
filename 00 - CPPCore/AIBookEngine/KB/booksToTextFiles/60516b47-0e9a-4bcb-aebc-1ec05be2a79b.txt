Dracula was written by Bram (Abraham) Stoker in 1897 and it was so popular  that a paperback was published just three years later. This chilling tale,  which is told through the diaries and letters of the main characters, is the  story of Count Dracula, a vampire who comes to Transylvania to feed on new  blood and to widen his ever-increasing circle of vampires.
