What happens in Vegas . . . doesn't always stay there.     Autumn Haven's Las Vegas "to-do" list said to catch a show and play the  slots-not wake up married to a sexy jerk like Sam LeClaire. The first moment  she saw him eyeing her like a luscious piece of the dessert buffet, her  usually responsible self told her to run. And she did-right into the wildest  fantasy weekend of her life. But Monday morning jolted her back to reality,  and before she could say "pass the coffee," Sam was gone.     Now a successful wedding planner, Autumn hasn't clapped eyes on the  heartbreaking hockey superstar for over two years . . . until she organizes  his teammate's "Special Day," where Sam makes a big play to pick up where he  left off! But she has vowed any man of hers plays for keeps. Is Sam the man  for her or does she banish him to the sin bin forever?
