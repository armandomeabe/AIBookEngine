A groundbreaking course, which combines ELT methodologies with games-based  learning to yield ambitious learning outcomes and to offer solid preparation  for Cambridge Young Learners English Testing (CYLET), KET and Trinity Exams.    Learners go on fascinating quests, follow clues, and sing and interact with  quirky and funky Poptropican characters in a safe and unique virtual world.  Islands offers a streamlined and gently paced syllabus with lots of  recycling.  Includes: *'Hide and 'revel' answers, links to further practice activities  and games that recycle the language of the unit and previous units and links  to audio and video content - without the need of a separate CD or DVD  player! * Stimulating and engaging digital board games with electric  spinners and flashcards and posters. * On each level of Islands Active Teach  there are four animated stories episodes. Each episode can be used to  reinforce and extend the language of two units. * Karaoke versions are  available for all the songs. * Download editable versions of all the tests  from the Test Booklet.
