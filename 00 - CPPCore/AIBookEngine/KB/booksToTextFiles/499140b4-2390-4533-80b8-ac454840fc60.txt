It's all fun and games until everybody gets hurt.Spencer, Hanna, Emily, and Aria are forced to watch as all their secrets finally come to light, from their littlest lies to their darkest deeds. Now, one by one, the girls' worlds come crashing down around them. Spencer gets kicked out of Princeton. Hanna gets kicked out of her dad's campaign-and his heart. Emily gets kicked to the curb. And Aria may get kicked out of the country.Thanks to me, these girls have lost everything-except their lives, of course. But I'm not done yet. And if my deadly plan succeeds, the pretty little liars will have finally told their last lie.
