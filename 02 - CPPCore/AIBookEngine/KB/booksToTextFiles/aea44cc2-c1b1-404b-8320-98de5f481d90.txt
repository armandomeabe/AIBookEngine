THE 8TH. HABIT FROM EFFECTIVENESS TO GREATNESSThe original seven habits of highly successful people are still relevant,  but Covey, author of the mega-bestseller of that title, says that the new  Information/Knowledge Worker Age, exemplified by the Internet, calls for an  eighth habit to achieve personal and organizational excellence: "Find your  voice and inspire others to find theirs." Covey sees leadership "as a choice  to deal with people in a way that will communicate to them their worth and  potential so clearly they will come to see it in themselves." His holistic  approach starts with developing one's own voice, one's "unique personal  significance." The bulk of the book details how, after finding your own  voice, you can inspire others and create a workplace where people feel  engaged. This includes establishing trust, searching for third alternatives  (not a compromise between your way and my way, but a third, better way) and  developing a shared vision. This book isn't easy going; less business jargon  and more practical examples would have made this livelier and more helpful.  But if organizations operated with Covey's ideas-and ideals-most people  would undoubtedly find work much more satisfying.
