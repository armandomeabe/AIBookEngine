Do fairies really exist? Bessie doesn't think so. But then she meets the mysterious Mrs. Leaf and so begins a lifelong friendship. As time passes, Bessie starts to wonder if she might have been wrong about fairies after all. The masterly realism and nostalgia of the pre-war setting is pervaded by a strong sense of anything being possible in this wonderful tale for older children.
