Oscar Wilde took London by storm with his first comedy, Lady Windermere's  Fan. The combination of dazzling wit, subtle social criticism, sumptuous  settings and the theme of a guilty secret proved a winner, both here and in  his next three plays, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband, and his  undisputed masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest.    This volume includes all Wilde's plays from his early tragedy Vera to the  controversial Salome and the little known fragments, La Sainte Courtisane  and A Florentine Tragedy. The edition affords a rare chance to see Wilde's  best known work in the context of his entire dramatic output, and to  appreciate plays which have hitherto received scant critical attention.  Wilde's plays have never failed to delight audiences and are a lasting  testimony to their author's supreme wit and theatrical genius.
