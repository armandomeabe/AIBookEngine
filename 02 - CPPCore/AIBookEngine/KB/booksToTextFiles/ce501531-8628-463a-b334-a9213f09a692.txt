The whale was blue and grey, large and clumsy, yet he was just rolling along and gliding on the warm sunny breeze with surprising grace.When eight-year-old Cappy discovers a whale swimming outside of his bedroom window, it's fair to say he's quite surprised. Given how long he's spent in hospital, Cappy has had plenty of time to read a LOT of books on animals, and he's never heard of a whale that can fly.What with his leukaemia, Cappy's used to not being allowed to do things he wants - like eating sweets, playing with dogs, or roaming too far from his protective family - so he's delighted when the amazing whale not only speaks to him, but asks him to join him for a ride in the sky. Soon, Cappy and the whale are the best of friends, and together they will go on an amazing journey of imagination, hope and curiosity.
