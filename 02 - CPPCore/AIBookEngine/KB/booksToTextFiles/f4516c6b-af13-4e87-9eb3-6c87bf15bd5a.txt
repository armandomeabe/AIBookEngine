It's boys vs. girls when the noisiest, most talkative, and most competitive  fifth graders in history challenge one another to see who can go longer  without talking. Teachers and school administrators are in an uproar, until  an innovative teacher sees how the kids' experiment can provide a terrific  and unique lesson in communication. In No Talking, Andrew Clements portrays  a battle of wills between some spunky kids and a creative teacher with the  perfect pitch for elementary school life that made Frindle an instant  classic.
