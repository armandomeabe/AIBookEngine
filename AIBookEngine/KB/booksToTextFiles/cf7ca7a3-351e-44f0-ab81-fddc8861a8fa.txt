DRAGONS LOVE TACOS BOOK TOYWith a smaller, bite-sized book and a 6-inch dragon plush toy, this special boxed edition of Dragons Love Tacos is the perfect birthday gift, story time treat, or travel companion.  Dragons love tacos. They love chicken tacos, beef tacos, great big tacos, and teeny tiny tacos. So if you want to lure a bunch of dragons to your party, you should definitely serve tacos. Buckets and buckets of tacos. Unfortunately, where there are tacos, there is also salsa. And if a dragon accidentally eats spicy salsa . . . oh, boy. You're in red-hot trouble.
