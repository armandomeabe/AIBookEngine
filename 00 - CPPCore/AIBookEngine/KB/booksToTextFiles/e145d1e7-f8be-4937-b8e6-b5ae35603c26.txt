Macmillan English Explorers is an exciting new reading programme developed  specifically for children learning English in kindergartens and primary  schools. Written with second language learners in mind, these books expose  children to real language and develop their reading and vocabulary skills.     Key features  Stories have been written using high-frequency words, plus story-specific  words which as far as possible are clarified by illustrations   High-frequency words have been taken from the UK National Literacy Strategy  and correlated with the Ladybird Key Words list and the words most commonly  used by L1 children in their own writing   Phonetically-regular words are included where they can be used in a  meaningful and contextualized way, but not to the detriment of the storyline    There are eight levels in the Macmillan English Explorers series, each  consisting of several genres, including traditional tales, contemporary  real-life stories, and comic characters.   Each Reader contains one complete story, and some of the characters reappear  at higher levels, providing a sense of continuity and familiarity to the  children.
