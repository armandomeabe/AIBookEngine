HERE'S TO US#1 New York Times bestseller! Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera reunite to continue the story of Arthur and Ben, the boys readers first fell for in the bestselling rom-com What If It's Us.Ben survived freshman year of college, but he's feeling more stuck than ever. His classes are a slog, his part-time job working with his father is even worse, and his best friend Dylan's been acting weird for weeks. Ben's only real bright spot is his writing partner Mario, who's been giving him a lot of Spanish lessons and even more kisses. Mario's big Hollywood dreams make Ben start to dream bigger-and the choices he makes now could be the key to reshaping his future. So why can't he stop thinking about a certain boy from his past?Arthur is back in New York City for the first time in two years, ready to take the theater world by a storm as the world's best . . . intern to the assistant of an off-off-Broadway director. Of course, it sucks to be spending the summer apart from his sweet, reliable boyfriend, Mikey, but he knows their relationship is strong enough to weather the distance. Which is why it's no big deal when his ex-boyfriend Ben stumbles back into the picture. And it's definitely fine that Ben's blissfully happy with some mystery boy. First loves are special, but it's way too late for what-ifs. Right?Even as the boys try to shake off the past, they keep running into each other in the present. Is this the universe trying to tell them there's a do-over in their future?Here's to Us is sure to be welcomed by fans old and new of these authors and their previous collaboration, What If It's Us.
