With an Introduction and Notes by Lionel Kelly, University of Reading    In 1915, Lawrence's frank representation of sexuality in The Rainbow caused  a furore and the novel was seized by the police and banned almost as soon as  it was published. Today it is recognised as one of the classic English  novels of the twentieth century.    The Rainbow is about three generations of the Brangwen family of  Nottinghamshire from the 1840s to the early years of the twentieth century.  Within this framework Lawrence's essential concern is with the passional  lives of his characters as he explores the pressures that determine their  lives, using a religious symbolism in which the 'rainbow' of the title is  his unifying motif. His primary focus is on the individual's struggle to  growth and fulfilment within marriage and changing social circumstances, a  process shown to grow more difficult through the generations. Young Ursula  Brangwen, whose story is continued in Women in Love, is finally the central  figure in Lawrence's anatomy of the confining structures of English social  life and the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the human  psyche.
