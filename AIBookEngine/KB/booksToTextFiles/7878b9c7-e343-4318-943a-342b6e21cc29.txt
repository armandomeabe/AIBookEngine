Big Nate is back, starring in the third instalment of his own super-funny  series. Big Nate is created by Lincoln Peirce, who inspired Jeff Kinney,  author of 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid'. Big Nate's scout troop is fundraising and  while door-to-door selling isn't really Nate's thing, there's nothing like a  Grand Prize to get him motivated. Especially when the prize is an awesomely  cool customised skateboard (and following an incident with a poodle and a  bridge Nate is in need of a new set of wheels). Nate HAS to win the prize  but to do that he must out-sell Artur - the luckiest boy at school. Will  Nate beat Artur to the prize (and possibly win over Jenny)? Or will he just  end up in detention?
