With an Introduction and Notes by Michael Irwin, Professor of English  Literature, University of Kent at Canterbury     None of the great Victorian novels is more vivid and readable than The Mayor  of Casterbridge. Set in the heart of Hardy's Wessex, the 'partly real,  partly dream country' he founded on his native Dorset, it charts the rise  and self-induced downfall of a single 'man of character'. The fast-moving  and ingeniously contrived narrative is Shakespearian in its tragic force,  and features some of the author's most striking episodes and brilliant  passages of description.
