From the authors of the breakout national bestseller All My Friends Are Dead (more than 100,000 copies in print) comes a brand new illustrated compendium of the humourous existential ruminations of people, animals, legendary monsters, and inanimate objects. Readers will appreciate the plight of the light bulb whose only friends are burnouts, the caterpillar whose friends have all really changed, the cookie whose friends are crumbs, the cactus whose friends always kind of look like they're flipping you off, the robot who was not programmed to understand the concept of friendship, and many more, and fans new and old will laugh (and cry) out loud with this new, darkly funny celebration of the inevitable.
