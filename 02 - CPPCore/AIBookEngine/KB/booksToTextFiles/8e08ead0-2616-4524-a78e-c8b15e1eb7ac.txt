Get to grips with your insides and discover how your brain works! This series takes readers on a visual tour of your mind, explaining the different parts that make up your brain, the important role it plays in day to day life and how nerves carry messages from your brain. Fun experiments and activities include finding your dominant side and making a thinking cap. Following on from the successful Science Crackers series, Body Works explores the science of the Human Body. Bitesize facts and gross stories make information easy to digest. Lively and informative text is supported by clearly labelled illustrations and detailed photographs, while questions help children to relate to science and comical cartoons help them to visualise scientific facts.
