A strange curse weighs on the Baskervilles since the time of the English Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville abducted and murdered a woman in the mires of Dartmoor only to be killed in turn by a huge demonic hound. Years later, apparitions of a diabolic and supernatural hound are still threatening the members of the Baskerville family. After Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead, Mr. James Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes for help. In order to solve this case, Holmes will have to travel to the inhospitable and desolate moors of Devonshire.
