Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved  about Britain-which is to say, all of it."    After nearly two decades spent on British soil, Bill  Bryson-bestsellingauthor of The Mother Tongue and Made in America-decided to  returnto the United States. ("I had recently read," Bryson writes, "that 3.7  million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time  or another,so it was clear that my people needed me.") But before departing,  he set out ona grand farewell tour of the green and kindly island that had  so long been his home.    Veering from the ludicrous to the endearing and back again, Notes from a  Small Island is a delightfully irreverent jaunt around the unparalleled  floating nation that has produced zebra crossings, Shakespeare, Twiggie  Winkie's Farm, and places with names like Farleigh Wallop and Titsey. The  result is an uproarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of  Britain, from the satiric pen of an unapologetic Anglophile.
