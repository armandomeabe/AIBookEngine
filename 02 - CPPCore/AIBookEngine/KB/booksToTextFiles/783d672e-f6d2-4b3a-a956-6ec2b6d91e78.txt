Written specially for students following the International Baccalaureate  (IB) Diploma, Biology for the IB Diploma is a major new textbook covering  the latest syllabus requirements for this experimental science. Chapters are  presented in syllabus order and their content reflects the necessary  coverage of all core Topics and Options for students at both Standard and  Higher levels. Throughout, the processes of science and something of its  history are introduced selectively to illustrate the possibilities and  limitations of science. * Chapters open with a list of 'Starting points'  that summarise essential concepts. * Topics and Options coverage accurately  reflects the Objectives and Command terms in which syllabus assessment  statements are phrased. * Material for Standard level and Higher level is  clearly identified. * Text is written in straightforward language with key  terms simply defined, and examples are drawn from a wide range of  international sources. * Main sections specify the syllabus sub-topic being  addressed, making links between the text and syllabus content self-evident.  * Photographs, electron micrographs and full-colour illustrations complement  the text, and illustrate principles and processes in context. *  Self-assessment questions and typical exam questions aid comprehension and  familiarise students with the syllabus requirements, improving exam  performance. * Links to Theory of Knowledge provide opportunities for  cross-curriculum study. * Extension boxes broaden information beyond the  core requirements. * Includes a chapter on the integration of theory with  practicals and projects and their presentation for Internal Assessment,  written by a guest author, Gary Seston, an experienced IB teacher and  examiner. * The glossary provides an invaluable reference for students.
