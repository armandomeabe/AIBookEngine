Big Nate is back starring in the second instalment of his own super-funny  series. Big Nate is created by Lincoln Peirce, who inspired Jeff Kinney,  author of 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid'. Big Nate has got his heart set on leading  his sports team to victory! But it won't be easy. He's stuck with Gina, his  all time enemy and really rubbish player. Worse yet they have to work  together on the class special project which means Gina's allowed to call  Nate - at home! Gina is at the top of Nate's list of Things I Can't Stand -  but will she stand in the way of his greatness? Will Nate win or lose? Pass  or fail? Or fall asleep in science and end up in detention again?
