THE PALE HORSEMAN - THE LAST KINGDOM 2Continuing the outstanding success of The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman is  the second installment of Bernard Cornwell,s fantastic series, following the  fate of Alfred the Great ,and the forging of Britain. It is the lowest time  for the Saxons. Defeated comprehensively by the Vikings who now occupy most  of England, Alfred and his very small group of surviving followers retreat  to the trackless marshlands of Somerset. There, forced to move restlessly to  escape betrayal or detection, using the marsh mists for cover, they travel  by small boats from one island refuge to another, hoping that they can  regroup and find some more strength and support. Only Uhtred remains  resolute. Determined to discover the enemy's strategies, he draws once again  on his Viking upbringing, and attempts to enter the Viking camps. His plan  is to become accepted by their leaders, and to sit in their councils and  uncover their plans. But once there, the attractions of his many friends  among the Vikings coupled with his disillusion with the Saxons' leadership  and anger at Alfred's criticism of his own conduct, draws him back again to  his allegiance to the Vikings. The Pale Horseman, an even more powerful and  dramatic book than The Last Kingdom, brings both Uhtred and the Saxons'  dilemmas vividly to life.BERNARD CORNWELLBERNARD CORNWELL is the author of over fifty novels, including the acclaimed New York Times bestselling Saxon Tales, which serve as the basis for the hit Netflix series The Last Kingdom.
