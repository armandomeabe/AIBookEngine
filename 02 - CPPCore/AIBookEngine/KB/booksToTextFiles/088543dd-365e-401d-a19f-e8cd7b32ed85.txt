Boris is a very affectionate monster. He likes nothing better than showering everyone with kisses and, though endearing, it can also be very ticklish. An interactive book with a difference. The reader is asked to help Boris brush his hair ready for his trip to the park and gets smothered in grateful kisses. The same happens when we feed him, and when he gets to the park none of the other little monsters want to play with him because he is so loud and boisterous.
