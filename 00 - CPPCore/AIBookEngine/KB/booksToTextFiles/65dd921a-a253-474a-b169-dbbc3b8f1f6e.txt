In the 1960s Paul changed the world with The Beatles. He has continued to push boundaries as a solo artist and through collaborations with world-renowned artists. He has received 18 Grammys, and in 1997 was knighted by H.M. The Queen for his services to music. Paul is also a dedicated philanthropist and a very proud grandfather.KATHRYN DURSTWith a background in animation, Kathryn has interned with Pixar Animation Studios in addition to working with various children's book publishers.
