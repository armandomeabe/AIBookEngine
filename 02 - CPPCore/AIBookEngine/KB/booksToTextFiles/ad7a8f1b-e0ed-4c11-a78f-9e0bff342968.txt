Interactive is an exciting four-level course for teenage learners from  elementary to upper-intermediate levels (CEF A2-B2). Interactive is a course  packed with up-to-the-minute, stimulating content. It will get and keep your  students talking, using real, contemporary English. 'Interaction' sections  give learners the confidence to use English in real-life situations and a  fold-out classroom language reference on the cover provides students with  the phrases they need for speaking activities. 'Skills4Real' sections,  'Culture UK' noticeboards and 'Culture World' magazines practise skills  using authentic reading material and unscripted listenings, with activities  and projects to put this language into practice. Teens will love the  realistic graphic novel which runs through each level, getting them reading  for pleasure.
