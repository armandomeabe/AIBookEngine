Mitford is a giraffe.But not your everyday, live-on-the-savannah giraffe.Mitford lives in the city.But not your everyday, filled-with-people city.This city is filled with animals.Animals who like to dress up,especially the animals who work at COVER magazine.Mitford would do ANYTHING to work there.But first Mitford must prove himself.Can Mitford survive the Fashion Zoo?!
