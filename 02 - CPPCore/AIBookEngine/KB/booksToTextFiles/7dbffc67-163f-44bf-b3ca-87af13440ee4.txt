This innovative and wildly funny read-aloud will be the Must Have book of  the season. You might think a book with no pictures seems boring and  serious. Except...here's how books work. Everything written on the page has  to be said by the person reading it aloud. Even if the words say...BLORK. Or  BLUURF. Even if the words are a preposterous song about eating ants for  breakfast, or just a list of astonishingly goofy sounds like BLAGGITY  BLAGGITY and GLIBBITY GLOBBITY.
