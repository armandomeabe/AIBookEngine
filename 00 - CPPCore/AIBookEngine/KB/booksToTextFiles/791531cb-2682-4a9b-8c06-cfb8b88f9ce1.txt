Language Teacher Supervision illuminates an under-explored area of the  language teaching profession. Using case studies of actual teaching  situations, the book explores such issues as teacher evaluation, autonomy,  authority and awareness and attitude. It contains a wealth of practical  detail on gathering data and providing feedback in post-observation  conferences with teachers. A variety of cases, together with a comprehensive  review of the literature, offers valuable insights into the dynamic,  interactive process of language teacher supervision. Follow-up discussion  questions, development tasks, and suggestions for further reading afford  avenues for further exploration.
