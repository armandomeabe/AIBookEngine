HAPPY TO HELP ( EVENTUALLY) - TOM GATES 20 The top-of-the-class, extra special 20th book from multi-million copy selling author and illustrator Liz Pichon. A feel-good, laugh-out-loud, packed-with-pictures Tom Gates story! It's TIDY UP Saturday, but Tom is VERY busy relaxing and not helping out much. Until he spots the art box of his dreams in a shop window and everything changes. He's suddenly focused on earning extra pocket money and helping with EVERYTHING. But nothing quite goes to plan. Washing and shrinking Delia's clothes isn't a good start. And the hours spent carefully cleaning cars with Derek are ruined overnight when a storm hits Oakfield Town, causing even MORE chaos. At this rate it's going to take a MILLION years for Tom to get the art box of his dreams… or will it?Edad recomendada: a partir de 8 años
