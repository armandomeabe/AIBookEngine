Reviews  'What distinguishes the series from all the others is the zest and freshness  of the text. Where the emphasis in other series is on plain and  straightforward language, Cambridge English Reading texts typically use very  modern expressions and the dialogue is faster moving. This has an impact on  the quality of the audio cassettes, which make for very enjoyable  listening.' David R. Hill, Survey Review: Readers, ELT Journal    'It was only a matter of time before a major ELT publisher set out to  challenge the market dominance of Penguin Classics in the area of readers .  CUP have hit back admirably. With something for everyone in your classes,  this series is well worth investing in. In fact, it's going to be a  difficult act to follow by other publishers.'
