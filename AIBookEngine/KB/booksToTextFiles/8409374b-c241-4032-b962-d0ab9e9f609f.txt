THE CROWNYou have the power to pass down ... a different kind of crown.Speaking from the future, a girl wears a crown made from the rubbish passed down to her by previous generations. Her Earth is covered by waste, but beneath the landfill she discovers a book of pictures that show her the past - our world as it is now - and she is filled with joy by the beautiful sky, land, sea and creatures that she sees. Alongside her companion horse, she experiences the beauty of our Earth and imagines a world where her crown is no longer made from rubbish, but from an abundance of life. This is a lyrical, stunningly illustrated debut that expresses our need to act now to save the environment, while weaving a positive message about protecting the world we live in.EMILY KAPFFI was born in Cornwall. My parents were farmers. We moved to Canada when I was nearly 9 and continued to farm out there for almost 9 years. Animals and nature have always been apart of my fabric and my work. My rural upbringing taught me common sense, initiative and about the sensitivity and awareness required to work with animals. It taught me about life and death and the equal value of both. It instilled an awareness and respect for the magic of creatures in their own right, without anthropomorphisising. This was the source of my inspiration to draw, to try to capture that magic in its truest form; perhaps helping others to see it too.Edad recomendada: A partir de 6 a√±os.
