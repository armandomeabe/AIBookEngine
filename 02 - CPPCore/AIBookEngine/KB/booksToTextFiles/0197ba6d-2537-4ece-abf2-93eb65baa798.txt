The truth is, we all tell lies... take a deep breath and get ready for the most twisty, tense and unsettling book of the summer. 'If, like me, you have been longing for a psycho-thriller of genius since you finished Gone Girl, then the wait is finally over. There are very few books in this world that are impossible to put down. Lie With Me is one of them.' Tony ParsonsIt starts with a lie. The kind we've all told - to a former acquaintance we can't quite place but still, for some reason, feel the need to impress. The story of our life, embellished for the benefit of the happily married lawyer with the kids and the lovely home.And the next thing you know, you're having dinner at their house, and accepting an invitation to join them on holiday - swept up in their perfect life, the kind you always dreamed of...Which turns out to be less than perfect. But by the time you're trapped and sweating in the relentless Greek sun, burning to escape the tension all around you - by the time you start to realise that, however painful the truth might be, it's the lies that cause the real damage...... well, by then, it could just be too late.
