Active Listening, Second Edition, is grounded in the theory that learners  are more successful listeners when they activate their prior knowledge of a  topic. Student's Book 2 is intended for low-intermediate to intermediate  students. The Student's Book offers 16 task-based units, each built around  an engaging topic. Through a careful balance of activities, students learn  to listen for main ideas, to listen for details, and to listen and make  inferences. Prelistening schema-building activities help students build  vocabulary, and listen-again activities provide additional skills practice.  A full page of optional speaking activities with pronunciation practice is  provided in each unit. Expansion units, with authentic student interviews,  offer rich cultural material and provide review. A free Self-Study Audio CD  is also included in every Student's Book.
