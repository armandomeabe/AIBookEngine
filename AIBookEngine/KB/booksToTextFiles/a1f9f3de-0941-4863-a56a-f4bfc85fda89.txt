DAVID GETS IN TROUBLEDavid doesn't mean to get in trouble. It's not his fault. Most of the time, it's just an accident! Or maybe he forgot something. Or some furniture got in the way. Whatever the situation, David has a really good explanation, and it will leave kids and parents laughing. Once again, David Shannon proves he knows every excuse in the book, especially when faced with the age-old problem of dealing with grown-ups. Soon, though, David realizes that making excuses makes him feel bad, and saying he's sorry makes him feel better.Once again, David Shannon entertains us with young David's mischievous antics and a lighthearted story that's sure to leave kids (and parents) laughing."This memorable character is nothing short of a force of nature."- Publishers WeeklyEdad recomendada: A partir de 6 a√±os.
