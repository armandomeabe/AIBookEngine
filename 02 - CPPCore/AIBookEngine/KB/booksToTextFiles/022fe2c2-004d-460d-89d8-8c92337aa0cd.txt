Fancy a slice of cherry pie? Let's get started. . . . What, no bowl? No pie pan? No pot holders?Join our young baker (and her little dog!) as they travel the United States-from New Hampshire to Hawaii, from Alaska to Texas-in search of the coal, cotton, clay, and granite they need to create all their baking tools.In a companion to her bestselling How to Make an Apple Pie and See the World, two-time Caldecott Honor illustrator Marjorie Priceman takes us on a round-the-U.S.A. journey by riverboat, taxi, train, and plane in a culinary adventure-and a playful celebration of America's natural resources.
