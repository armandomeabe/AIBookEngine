I'M A UNICORN - 978-1-5362-1976-0Edad recomendada: A partir de 6 a√±os.SINOPSISWhat happens when a one-horned calf with impeccable logic is convinced they're a unicorn? Helen Yoon spins an endearing comedy of self-determination for gigglers everywhere."See?" cries the calf. "Uni means one, and corn means horn!" Even their baby picture proves it: they were born with one horn! But as the eager little calf continues their research, a budding identity crisis arises when they realize they don't quite check all the boxes-should a certain lack of moonlight sparkle or silky mane or rainbow poop decide the issue. Perhaps some unexpected encouragement from a pack of "real" unicorns might be just the assurance they need? Helen Yoon, the comic talent behind Sheepish (Wolf Under Cover) and the anarchic Off-Limits, returns with a clarion call for self-doubters everywhere to embrace who they are-unicorn or otherwise.
