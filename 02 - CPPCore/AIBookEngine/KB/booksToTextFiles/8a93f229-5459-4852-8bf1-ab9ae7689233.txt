Choices meets the challenge of motivating older teenagers who need to  achieve academic and educational goals in a modern world.     Combining contemporary, cultural and educational topics with a wide range of  digital, online (MyEnglishLab) and print material, Choices gives teachers  the power to adapt to their classrooms, while the authentic BBC and Channel  4 video clips keep interest levels high and boredom factors low!      10 thematic modules each divided into sections:   - Topic Talk (opening page) - networks that provide guided choice by  marrying functional language with lexical items   - Grammar Skills   - Writing Workshop   - Speaking Workshop
