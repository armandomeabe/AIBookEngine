The  wide variety of entertaining and 'real' text types such as websites and  magazine articles ensures you get material students will want to read. The  interesting content motivates students to develop essential skills such as  reading for detail and reading for gist, and each reading comprehension is  thoroughly supported with a pre and post reading activity. The writing tasks  give students the opportunity to write about themselves. This increases  their confidence and enthusiasm to write. Each task is carefully designed so  students receive the right amount of support and challenge to improve their  writing skills.

Vocabulary exercises give students the chance to  practice the new words they have learnt alongside familiar vocabulary items  from their course book.
