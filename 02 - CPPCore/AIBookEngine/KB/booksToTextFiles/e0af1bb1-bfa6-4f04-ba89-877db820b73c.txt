The volume offers an explanatory account of the progress of academic  language proficiency testing in the UK (and later Australia), from the  British Council's English Proficiency Test Battery (EPTB), through the  revolutionary English Language Testing Service (ELTS) to the present  solution of IELTS. The three stages of academic language testing in the UK  over the last 50 years move from grammar through real life to features of  language use. At the same time, comparison of predictive validities suggests  that all three measures account for very similar shares of the variance  (about 10%) and that therefore the choice of an academic language  proficiency test is determined only in part by predictive validity: other  factors such as test delivery, test renewal in response to fashion, research  and impact on stakeholders, and assessment of all four language skills are  also important.
