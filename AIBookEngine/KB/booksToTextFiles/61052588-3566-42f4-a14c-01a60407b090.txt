Abby is a teenager, and she doesn't talk much to her parents. Abby's dad works hard for an oil company, and Abby's mom doesn't like her friends. Then, one summer, Abby stays with her crazy Aunt May in California. Here - with Aunt May and her neighbours Diego and Bianca - she learns to see things differently. But, one night, there's an oil spill on the beautiful beach near their home.
