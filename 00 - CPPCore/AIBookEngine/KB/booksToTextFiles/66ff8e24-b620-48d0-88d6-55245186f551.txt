Light Up highly supports the fact that learning a language is a unique and personal experience for every single student. Providing students with a variety of learning environments that may open up a whole new world of opportunities: appealing to different learning styles and catering for individual needs can definitely facilitate their language acquisition. We believe that students should be granted the opportunity to learn at their own pace. Blended learning may turn out to be an ally in this sense, helping overcome certain time constraints and giving students the possibility of learning anywhere, anytime. Technology has also been proven to foster autonomous learning. With the Student's Pack, your students will get free access to MyEnglishLab (MEL) platform, which provides them with: Interactive online activities with instant feedback and embedded audio Motivating hints and tips to encourage and support learning Remediation activities available for some activities, automatically identifying areas of need and reinforcing learning.
