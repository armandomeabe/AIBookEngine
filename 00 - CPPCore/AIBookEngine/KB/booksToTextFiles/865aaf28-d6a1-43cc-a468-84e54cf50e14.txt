MOTHER TERESA - LITTLE PEOPLE BIG DREAMS (HB)Agnes (later to become Mother Teresa) was born in Skopje, Macedonia. She was raised to love God and love others above all else, and from an early age, she knew she wanted to dedicate herself to religion, so she became a nun. She was fascinated by stories of missionaries helping people and wanted to do the same.She travelled to Ireland, and then to India, where she worked hard to help all those around her. She taught in a school, but realised she could do more, and so she founded a hospital in an old temple, where she fed and cared for the poor and the sick.She spent the rest of her life caring for those in need around the world and is now remembered as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. This moving book features stylish and quirky illustrations and extra facts at the back, including a biographical timeline with historical photos and a detailed profile of Mother Teresa's amazing life.Little People, BIG DREAMS is a bestselling biography series for kids that explores the lives of outstanding people, from designers and artists to scientists and activists.
