On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as  richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound  for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The  passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the  seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought  terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great  transatlantic "Greyhounds"-the fastest liner then in service-and her  captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly  strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from  attack.     Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and  Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige.  Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's  U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward  Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small-hubris, a chance  fog, a closely guarded secret, and more-all converged to produce one of the  great disasters of history.    It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells  it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger  portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour  and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from  famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect  Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the  widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.     Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional  power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been  obscured by history.
