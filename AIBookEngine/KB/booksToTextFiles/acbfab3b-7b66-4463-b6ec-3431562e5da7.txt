BUSINESS START-UP  Business Start-up is a two-level course for beginners and false beginners  who need English for their work. It takes low-level students up to the point  where they can start preparing for the BEC Preliminary Examination (early B1  level) and provides a solid foundation for further learning.    The Student's Books bring reality to even the most basic levels of language  learning through the presentation of natural language in authentic contexts,  a regular focus on real companies and products, and practice in the  communication skills that professionals really need.    The A5 size Workbooks come with a CD-ROM/Audio CD offering self-study  grammar and vocabulary activities, as well as listening practice on the  move.    The Teacher's Books include full classroom notes, additional communicative  practice activities and regular progress tests, plus an end of  course/placement test.
