ARE YOU THERE, GOD? IT'S ME MARGARETThe classic teen novel from bestselling and iconic author Judy Blume, now celebrating it's 50th anniversary. OVER NINE MILLION COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE. Meet Margaret. She's going through all the same things most teenage girls have to face; fitting in, friendship and first bras. Life isn't easy for Margaret. She's moved away from her childhood home, she's starting a new school, finding new friends - and she's convinced she's not normal. For a start she hasn't got a clue whether she wants to be Jewish like her father or Christian like her mother. Everyone else seems really sure of who they are. And, worst of all, she's a 'late developer'. She just knows that all her friends are going to need a bra before she does. It's too embarrassing to talk to her parents about these things. So she talks to God instead - and waits for an answer . . . This is a 50th anniversary of Judy Blume's bestselling classic teen novel, Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret featuring a fresh, contemporary cover look.JUDY BLUMEJudy Blume has been winning legions of fans around the world with her stories.
