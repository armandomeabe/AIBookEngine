Number Puzzles will really test the reader's maths skills, including everything from simple number squares to punishing number patterns. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Rubik cube, there is a special exhibition of the toy puzzle. Titled Beyond Rubik's Cube, it explores the humble beginnings of the cube, showing its first prototypes made out of wood and rubber bands. Four exciting books take readers on an engaging adventure into the science and maths beyond the Rubik's Cube. Each title explores key content from the exhibition. Focusing on four of the main themes from the exhibition, each puzzle book contains over 40 puzzles.
