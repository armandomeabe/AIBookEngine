With her magic paintbrush, Shen can paint steaming pots full of fish and oysters to feed the hungry people in her village, but when the evil emperor hears of her gift he commands Shen to paint gold for him instead. She is determined to keep her promise to paint only for the poor, but how can she match the emperor's mighty power?In The Magic Paintbrush, Julia Donaldson's vibrant verse and Joel Stewart's beautiful illustrations bring vibrant life to a traditional tale of how a little girl's integrity can withstand the corruption of power and greed. This edition features a stunning, redesigned cover, making it a must-have addition to the bookshelves of all Donaldson fans - big and small!
