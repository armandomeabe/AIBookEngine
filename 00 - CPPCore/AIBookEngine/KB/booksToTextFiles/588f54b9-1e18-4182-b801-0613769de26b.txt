The Kite, by Rick Sampedro    Ehud and Elisa like flying kites. One windy day Ehud's kite goes up and he  can't see it. Ehud is sad. Then it comes down in Elisa's garden.  Elisa gives Ehud his kite and he is happy. But then Ehud and Elisa look at  their fathers. Their fathers aren't friends. They are sad. Can the children  think of a way to make everyone happy?
