Introduction and Notes by Cedric Watts, Professor of English Literature,  University of Sussex     Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's four great tragedies, encompassing  witchcraft, bloody murder, ghostly apparitions as well as high poetry,  blended in such a way as to demonstrate the assured dramatic touch of  Shakespeare's maturity. Macbeth's tragedy is that of a good, brave and  honourable man turned into the personification of evil by the workings of  unreasonable ambition. It was a lesson lost on King James I & VI, for whom  the play was written.
