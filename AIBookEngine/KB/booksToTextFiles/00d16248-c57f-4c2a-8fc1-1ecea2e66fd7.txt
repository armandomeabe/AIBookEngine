Itïs the start of the year at McKindly High  and Glee ]Club is practicing for the "fall in  love with music" show. Thereïs one  problem - they sound terrible! Rachel is  talented but very annoying. Will  Mercedes let her join Glee Club?  Homecoming week is also around the  corner. Can the kids from Glee Club show  everyone that they're awesome singers  and not just "geeks"?
