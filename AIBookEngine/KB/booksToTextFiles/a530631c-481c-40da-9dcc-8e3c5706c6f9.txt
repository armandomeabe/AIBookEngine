This novel, based on George Eliot's own experiences of provincial life, is a  masterpiece of ambiguity in which moral choice is subjected to the hypocrisy  of the Victorian age.    As the headstrong Maggie Tulliver grows into womanhood, the deep love which  she has for her brother Tom turns into conflict, because she cannot  reconcile his bourgeois standards with her own lively intelligence. Maggie  is unable to adapt to her community or break free from it, and the result,  on more than one level, is tragedy.
