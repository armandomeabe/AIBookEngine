Jeannette Walls's The Glass Castle was "nothing short of spectacular"  (Entertainment Weekly). Now she brings us the story of her grandmother --  told in a voice so authentic and compelling that the book is destined to  become an instant classic.   "Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did." So begins the story  of Lily Casey Smith, in Jeannette Walls's magnificent, true-life novel based  on her no-nonsense, resourceful, hard working, and spectacularly compelling  grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At  fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred  miles on her pony, all alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car  ("I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if  they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the  place") and fly a plane, and, with her husband, ran a vast ranch in Arizona.  She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother,  Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle.
