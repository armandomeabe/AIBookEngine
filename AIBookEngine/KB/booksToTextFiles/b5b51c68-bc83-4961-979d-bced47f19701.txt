In an all-new addition to the New York Times bestselling series that's as  popular as it is dorky, Nikki Maxwell is determined to help out her crush!  Nikki Maxwell isn't at all surprised to find out that her crush Brandon  volunteers at a local animal shelter. He's such a sweet guy-of course he  wants to help those adorable puppies! Then Brandon tells her that the  shelter is in danger of closing, and Nikki knows she can't let that happen.  Especially when she discovers a shocking secret about Brandon that makes  keeping that shelter open more important than ever. So Nikki and her friends  Chloe and Zoey enter an ice skating competition to help raise money for the  shelter, but (big surprise) Mackenzie has to stick her nose in and cause  trouble so that she can be the one to swoop in and save the day. No way will  Nikki let that happen: She'll just have to come up with some extra creative  ideas this time!
