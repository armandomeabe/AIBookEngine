The national bestseller about a curious rabbit is now available in a sturdy board book edition, just right for little hands, Easter baskets, and welcoming spring. Caldecott Medalist and New York Times-bestselling author Kevin Henkes's glorious story stars a rambunctious and adventurous little white rabbit who discovers, in the end, that a mother's love is constant and true.

It's wonderful to wonder about many things and exciting to explore the world-but true happiness is knowing where you belong and who loves you best of all. Bright greens, yellows, pinks, and purples-the welcome colors of spring-dance across the pages of this pitch-perfect and critically acclaimed book for very young children. This board book by award-winning author Kevin Henkes is a wonderful choice for Easter baskets, as a gift for a new baby, for reading before bedtime, or for sharing anytime.
