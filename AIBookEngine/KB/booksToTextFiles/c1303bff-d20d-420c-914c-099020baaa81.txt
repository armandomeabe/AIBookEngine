Starred Review. Freelance writer Walls doesn't pull her punches. She opens  her memoir by describing looking out the window of her taxi, wondering if  she's "overdressed for the evening" and spotting her mother on the sidewalk,  "rooting through a Dumpster." Walls's parents-just two of the unforgettable  characters in this excellent, unusual book-were a matched pair of  eccentrics, and raising four children didn't conventionalize either of them.  Her father was a self-taught man, a would-be inventor who could stay longer  at a poker table than at most jobs and had "a little bit of a drinking  situation," as her mother put it. With a fantastic storytelling knack, Walls  describes her artist mom's great gift for rationalizing. Apartment walls so  thin they heard all their neighbors? What a bonus-they'd "pick up a little  Spanish without even studying." Why feed their pets? They'd be helping them  "by not allowing them to become dependent." While Walls's father's version  of Christmas presents-walking each child into the Arizona desert at night  and letting each one claim a star-was delightful, he wasn't so dear when he  stole the kids' hard-earned savings to go on a bender. The Walls children  learned to support themselves, eating out of trashcans at school or painting  their skin so the holes in their pants didn't show. Buck-toothed Jeannette  even tried making her own braces when she heard what orthodontia cost. One  by one, each child escaped to New York City. Still, it wasn't long before  their parents appeared on their doorsteps. "Why not?" Mom said. "Being  homeless is an adventure."
