The image of drowned circus cages in the trash-filled canals of Venice,  California, both haunts and illuminates famed fantasy and science fiction  author Ray Bradbury's rare venture into the mystery field. Like filmmaker  Federico Fellini, Bradbury is fascinated by the seedy splendor of cheap  carnivals and circuses--"a long time before, in the early Twenties, these  cages had probably rolled by like bright summer storms with animals prowling  them, lions opening their mouths to exhale hot meat breaths. Teams of white  horses had dragged their pomp through Venice and across the fields."
