classic memoir of prison breaks and adventure -- a bestselling phenomenon  of the 1960s Condemned for a murder he had not committed, Henri Charriere  (nicknamed Papillon) was sent to the penal colony of French Guiana.  Forty-two days after his arrival he made his first break, travelling a  thousand gruelling miles in an open boat. Recaptured, he went into solitary  confinement and was sent eventually to Devil's Island, a hell-hole of  disease and brutality. No one had ever escaped from this notorious prison --  no one until Papillon took to the shark-infested sea supported only by a  makeshift coconut-sack raft. In thirteen years he made nine daring escapes,  living through many fantastic adventures while on the run -- including a  sojourn with South American Indians whose women Papillon found welcomely  free of European restraints! Papillon is filled with tension, adventure and  high excitement. It is also one of the most vivid stories of human endurance  ever written. Henri Charriere died in 1973 at the age of 66.
