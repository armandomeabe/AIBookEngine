From the beginning of human history, people have moved from one place to  another. They seek better jobs and schools and leave behind unstable  political conditions and limited opportunities. These factors often cause  people to immigrate from less developed countries to more developed  countries. The same factors also lead people to migrate within a country.  "Migration" examines the forces behind migration, the challenges that  migrants face, and the ways in which new populations enrich their  communities.  Case Study: Mexico City / Amsterdam
