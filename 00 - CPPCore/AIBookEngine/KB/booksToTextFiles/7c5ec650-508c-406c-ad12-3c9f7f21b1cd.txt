EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE#1 BESTSELLER â€¢ The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author"A thoughtfully written, persuasive account explaining emotional intelligence and why it can be crucial."-USA TodayEveryone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our "two minds"-the rational and the emotional-and how they together shape our destiny.Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart-and they aren't fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood-with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work.  The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time-we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined. With a new introduction from the author, the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition prepares readers, now more than ever, to reach their fullest potential and stand out from the pack with the help of EI.DANIEL GOLEMANDaniel Goleman is the New York Times bestselling author of the groundbreaking book Emotional Intelligence.
