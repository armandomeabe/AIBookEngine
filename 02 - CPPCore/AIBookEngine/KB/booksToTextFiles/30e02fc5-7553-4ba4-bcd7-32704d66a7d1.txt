The Cambridge Checkpoint English suite provides a comprehensive, structured resource which covers the Secondary 1 framework for English and seamlessly progresses into the next key stage (covered by our Cambridge IGCSEÂ® First Language English series). Designed to be used alongside the Cambridge Checkpoint English Coursebook 8, this accessible, write-in workbook provides exercises to help students build on the skills taught in the Coursebook, for differentiation, and further practice in the classroom or at home. The 12 themed units mirror the structure and content of the Coursebook, and answers to the exercises are included on the Teacher's Resource CD-ROM, which is available separately.
