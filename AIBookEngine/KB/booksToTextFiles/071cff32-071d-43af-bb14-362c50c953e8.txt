Next Move MyEnglishLab is a complete and comprehensive set of practice  materials for the student to use independently at home or in the digital  classroom. It provides students with reinforcement and extra practice of  grammar, vocabulary and skills through a wide range of exercises and varied  activity types.  While in structure it mirrors the Students' Book, MyEnglishLab also provides  students with an extensive full-colour reference section covering Grammar,  Speaking and Listening and Pronunciation. It is ideal for mixed-ability  groups as activities are classified with stars according to their level of  difficulty. It should be possible for all students to complete the one-star  activities, while two-star activities are aimed at the average students.  Work is assigned digitally and student scores are recorded in the Gradebook  to be monitored by the teacher. Feedback is given by grammar tips at  relevant points.
