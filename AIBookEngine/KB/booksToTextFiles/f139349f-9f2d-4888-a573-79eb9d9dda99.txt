London 1923. The First World War has been over for five years, but the effects are still being felt all round the metropolis. A ocialite and politician's wife prepares for one of her famous parties while somewhere else in the city an old friend contemplates the pain of past and present love, a war veteran struggles with his inner demons, and other characters live out the uncertainties and dramas of post-war English society. All touch each other in some way with their actions, directly or obliquely.Mrs Dalloway is a novel that details a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway in post-World War I. It is one of Woolf's best-known novels.
