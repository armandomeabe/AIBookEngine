ALICEÂ´S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND - 978-987-8978-18-5Age: 13 years.LEWIS CARROLLLewis Carroll, born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-98), grew up in Cheshire in the village of Daresbury, the son of a parish priest. He was a brilliant mathematician, a skilled photographer and a meticulous letter and diary writer. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, inspired by Alice Liddell, the daughter of the Dean of Christ Church in Oxford, was published in 1865, followed by Through the Looking-Glass in 1871. He wrote numerous stories and poems for children including the nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark and fairy stories Sylvie and Bruno.SYNOPSISDuring a boring afternoon, while her sister is sewing under a tree, Alice sees a talking, clothed white rabbit with a pocket watch run past. She decides to follow him down a rabbit hole when, suddenly, she falls a long way into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative, plot, structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre. This volume includes John Tenniel's original illustrations, beautifully colored by author and illustrator Leo Batic.
