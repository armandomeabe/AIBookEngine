FRANNY AND ZOOEYThe author writes: FRANNY came out in The New Yorker in 1955, and was  swiftly followed, in 1957 by ZOOEY. Both stories are early, critical entries  in a narrative series I'm doing about a family of settlers in  twentieth-century New York, the Glasses. It is a long-term project, patently  an ambiguous one, and there is a real-enough danger, I suppose that sooner  or later I'll bog down, perhaps disappear entirely, in my own methods,  locutions, and mannerisms. On the whole, though, I'm very hopeful. I love  working on these Glass stories, I've been waiting for them most of my life,  and I think I have fairly decent, monomaniacal plans to finish them with due  care and all-available skill.Edad recomendada: Adultos.
