Four time Caldecott Honor winner Leo Lionni's beloved tale about three young frogs learning to work together.Three selfish frogs live together on an island in the middle of Rainbow Pond. All day long they bicker: It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! But a bad storm and a big brown toad help them realize that sharing is much more fun. With characteristic clarity, simplicity and exuberance, Leo Lionni makes it possible for kids to see themselves through the antics of others who share our world.
