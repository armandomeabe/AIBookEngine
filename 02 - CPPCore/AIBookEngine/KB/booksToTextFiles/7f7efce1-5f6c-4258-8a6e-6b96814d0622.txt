Wendy Mass celebrates another magical birthday!  Amanda and Leo have a history with birthdays. Now their friend's little  sister, Grace, has fallen into a strange frozen state on her birthday, and  Amanda and Leo must travel in time in order to fix whatever's wrong. As they  journey back to each of Grace's birthdays, they start seeing all sorts of  patterns . . . which raise all sorts of questions.    Amanda and Leo are going to have to unravel the threads of the past and  present - and travel much further than they ever imagined - if they're going  to save Grace. Luckily, a little birthday magic always helps in the charming  and funny Willow Falls series by Wendy Mass, where everything is possible  and there are no coincidences.
