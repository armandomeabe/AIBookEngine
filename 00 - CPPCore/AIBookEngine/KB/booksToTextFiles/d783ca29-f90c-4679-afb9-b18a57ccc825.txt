And Jack should know. Because an ogre has just appeared in his garden and tried to EAT HIS AUNT.

But then again, how many terrifying, bloodthirsty monsters can there really be?(Answer: ABSOLUTELY LOADS. And a bear called Humbert).A hilarious and accessible story, packed full of illustrations - that gives a twist to all your favourite fairytales and will change everything you thought you knew about monsters! Perfect for apprentice monster hunters aged 8 to 800.Edad recomendada: a partir de 8 a√±os
