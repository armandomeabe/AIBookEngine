CONCRETE ROSEFrom the international phenomenon Angie Thomas comes a hard-hitting return to Garden Heights with the story of Maverick Carter, Starr's father, set seventeen years before the events of the award-winning The Hate U Give.The son of a drug king, seventeen-year-old Maverick Carter is negotiating life in Garden Heights as he balances school, slinging dope, and working two jobs while his dad is in prison. He's got it all under control - until, that is, Mav finds out he's a father. Suddenly he has a baby, Seven, who depends on him for everything. Loyalty, revenge and responsibility threaten to tear Mav apart, especially after the brutal murder of a loved one. So when Mav is offered the chance to go straight, it's an opportunity - in a world where he's expected to amount to nothing - to prove he's different and figure out for himself what it really means to be a man.ANGIE THOMASAngie Thomas was born, raised and still resides in Mississippi as indicated by her accent.
