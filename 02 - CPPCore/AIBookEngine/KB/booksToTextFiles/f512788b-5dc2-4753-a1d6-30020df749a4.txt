A DUTIFUL BOYWINNER of the Polari First Book Prize 2021WINNER of the LAMBDA 2021 Literary Award for Best Gay Memoir/BiographyA Dutiful Boy is Mohsin's personal journey from denial to acceptance: a revelatory memoir about the power of love, belonging, and living every part of your identity.Growing up in a devout Muslim household, it felt impossible for Mohsin to be gay. Unable to be open with his family, and with difficult conditions at school, he felt his opportunities closing around him.

Mohsin was confronted with the biggest decision he would ever make: to live the life that was expected of him or to live as his authentic self.MOHSIN ZAIDIMohsin Zaidi is a criminal barrister at one of the top chambers in the country and represents clients in a number of high-profile cases.
