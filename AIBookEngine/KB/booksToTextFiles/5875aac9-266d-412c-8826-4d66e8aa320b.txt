Whatever the genre, she hopes she creates characters you can root for.When she's not reading or writing, she's with her family, probably messing up a recipe or going on a hike that she thinks she can do, but in reality she can't because she remembers that all she does is sit at a computer all day and write her heart out.Edad: adultos j√≥venes
