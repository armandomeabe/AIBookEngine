There, she wrote and illustrated her first picture book,  King & King (2000), with co-author and illustrator, Stern Nijland. Their book is now published in eight languages! King & King was such a hit that it was taken to the theater stage where it has been preformed from Vienna to Mexico City. At the request of their American publisher Tricycle Press (an imprint of Random House Children's Books), the illustrator duo made a sequel, King & King & Family (2004), about the kings adopting a child.Linda de Haan has been a full-time illustrator for over ten years and currently works from her home studio.
