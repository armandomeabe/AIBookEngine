Bonnie and Clyde, they thought. And what's-his-name, the sidekick. Three  teenagers with dead-end lives, and chips on their shoulders, and guns.    The first person they killed was a highway patrolman. The second was a woman  during a robbery. Then, hell, why not keep on going? As their crime spree  cuts a swath through rural Minnesota, some of it captured on the killers'  cell phones and sent to a local television station, Bureau of Criminal  Apprehension investigator Virgil Flowers joins the growing army of cops  trying to run them down. But even he doesn't realize what's about to happen  next.
