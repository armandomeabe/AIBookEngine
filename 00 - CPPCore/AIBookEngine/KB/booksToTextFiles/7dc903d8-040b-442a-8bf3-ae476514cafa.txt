Written by an experienced IGCSE teacher and trainer and endorsed by CIE,  this series is up to date and comprehensive in its coverage. Workbook 2  accompanies Coursebook 2 in this third-edition series and is presented in an  accessible new design. It is divided into four themed parts selected for  their relevance to students worldwide. Each part is subdivided into succinct  units, based on the specific skill areas of the syllabus, so providing many  opportunities for students to practise their reading, writing and listening  skills. The units progressively build on language skills and help students  to develop their examination technique. An audio CD is included for use with  the listening activities.
