Written for use with the Cambridge Primary Mathematics Curriculum Framework, and endorsed by Cambridge International Examinations, the Cambridge Primary Mathematics series is informed by the most up-to-date teaching philosophies from around the world. It aims to support teachers to help all learners become confident and successful mathematicians through a fun and engaging scheme. Through an investigatory approach children learn the skills of problem solving in the context of other mathematical strands in the course. The course will encourage learners to be independent thinkers with the confidence to tackle a wide range of problems who understand the value and relevance of their mathematics. Classroom discussion is encouraged to help learners become good mathematical communicators, to justify answers and to make connections between ideas
