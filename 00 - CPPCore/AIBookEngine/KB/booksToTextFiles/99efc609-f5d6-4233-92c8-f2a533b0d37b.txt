The novel follows the life of its eponymous heroine, Moll Flanders, through  its many vicissitudes, which include her early seduction, careers in crime  and prostitution, conviction for theft and transportation to the plantations  of Virginia, and her ultimate redemption and prosperity in the New World.    Moll Flanders was one of the first social novels to be published in English  and draws heavily on Defoe's experience of the topography and social  conditions prevailing in the London of the late 17th century.
