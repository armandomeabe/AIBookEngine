HOLD ME CLOSER - THE TINY COOPER STORY - 978-0-147-51610-7Edad recomendada: A partir de 15 a√±os.DAVID LEVITHANWhen not writing during spare hours on weekends, David Levithan is editorial director at Scholastic and the founding editor of the PUSH imprint, which is devoted to finding new voices and new authors in teen literature. His acclaimed novels Boy Meets Boy and The Realm of Possibility started as stories he wrote for his friends for Valentine's Day (something he's done for the past 22 years and counting) that turned themselves into teen novels. He's often asked if the book is a work of fantasy or a work of reality, and the answer is right down the middle-it's about where we're going, and where we should be.SINOPSISIt's Tiny Cooper's turn in the spotlight in this companion novel to New York Times bestseller Will Grayson, Will Grayson. Jazz hands at the ready!
