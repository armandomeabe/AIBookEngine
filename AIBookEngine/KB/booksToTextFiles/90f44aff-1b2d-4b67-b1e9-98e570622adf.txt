The Workbook follows the Students' Book structure:Exercises are at two levels of difficulty to cater for Mixed Ability Classes.Each input lesson ends with a Grammar Summary, with examples and simple rules. Language Round-Ups give extra practice and provide Self-check score boxes and an Audio answer key so students can check their knowledge.Skills Practice Pages focus on reading, writing and listening.Live Beat is a new four-level course that keeps teenage students motivated and focused to achieve better learning outcomes. It builds on the successful approach used by the same authors in the bestselling Upbeat course. Improvement in communication skills is measurable against the Global Scale of English.
