The monarch butterfly, one of the most seemingly delicate of all of nature's  animals, proves to be one of the toughest in this reader. Making the yearly  trip from the Northern United States and Canada to the Oyamel forest of  Mexico is no easy task, and it takes five generations of butterflies in  order to do so. Battling cold temperatures and the threat of starvation,  these beautiful insects complete an almost 3,000 mile journey over the  course of two months, only to have to turn and around and head back home.
