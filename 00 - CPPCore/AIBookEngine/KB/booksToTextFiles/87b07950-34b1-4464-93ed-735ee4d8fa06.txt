Flies are a nuisance. They are annoying when they buzz around you, but you  can brush them away with your hand. After all, a fly is only about half the  size of your fingernail. But suppose it wasn't. Catch a fly and look at it  closely - look at its head, its eyes, its legs. Now imagine that this thing  was the size of a human being . . . These eight stories offer horror in many  shapes and forms, in worlds full of monsters and evil spirits, where terror  lies waiting in the shadows, and where the living and the dead dance hand in  hand.
