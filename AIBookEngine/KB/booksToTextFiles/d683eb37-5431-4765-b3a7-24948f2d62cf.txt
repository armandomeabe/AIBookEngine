The stellar duo behind Hoot Owl: Master of Disguise reunites to create a book that will have children (and their parents!) roaring with laughter once again. From the team behind the acclaimed Hoot Owl, Master of Disguise comes a very scary read-aloud story ... or is it? Monster wants to be in a scary story - but is he brave enough? Scary stories have creepy witches and creaky stairs and dark hallways and spooky shadows... Oh my goodness me! That is very scary. Maybe, a funny story would be better after all? Brilliantly interactive, children will delight in the wickedly funny turn-of-the-pages, see themselves in the goofy, unconventional monster, and revel in the bold, hilarious illustration of celebrated graphic artist, Jean Jullien.
