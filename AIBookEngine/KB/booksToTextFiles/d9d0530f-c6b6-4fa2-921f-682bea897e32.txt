Without meaning to, we constantly color-code children, segregating them by gender based on their presumed interests. Our social dependence on these norms has far-reaching effects, such as leading girls to dislike math or increasing aggression in boys.In this practical guide, developmental psychologist (and mother of two) Christia Spears Brown uses science-based research to show how over-dependence on gender can limit kids, making it harder for them to develop into unique individuals. With a humorous, fresh, and accessible perspective, Parenting Beyond Pink & Blue addresses all the issues that contemporary parents should consider-from gender-segregated birthday parties and schools to sports, sexualization, and emotional intelligence. This guide empowers parents to help kids break out of pink and blue boxes to become their authentic selves.PRAISE"Practical and research-based, Parenting Beyond Pink-and-Blue is a terrific guide for parents who want to do the best for both their sons and daughters."-Lise Eliot, PhD, author of Pink Brain, Blue Brain "Whether you are a parent who believes that boys and girls are 'just different' or a parent who believes that gender differences are all 'just culture,' you will find valuable science and advice in Parenting Beyond Pink & Blue."-Lynn S. Liben, Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Pennsylvania State University "Christia Spears Brown has hit a home run! Unlike many parenting books, this one is based on scientific evidence and conveyed in an engaging writing style. If you want your child to grow up to have opportunities unconstrained by old-fashioned gender stereotypes, this is the book for you."-Prof. Janet Shibley Hyde, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and author of Half the Human Experience: the Psychology of Women "Parents want to raise strong and competent daughters and sons, but how can they know what to do and not do when they are bombarded with messages about the 'natural' traits and abilities of boys and girls. Christia Spears Brown provides great guidelines for helping all children develop their unique talents by avoiding the traps set by our beliefs about gender differences. It is great read for concerned parents, grandparents, teachers, and others."-Dr. Diane F. Halpern, Dean of Social Sciences at Minerva Schools and KGI and McElwee Family Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College√çNDICEPrologue On Being the Weird Daughter-in-Law               Part IGender Differences: changing our focusChapter 1 Noticing Gender               Chapter 2 Why Labels Matter               Chapter 3 Why We Focus on Gender Differences              Part IIgender facts: science and stereotypesChapter 4 There Are Gender Differences            Chapter 5 How Different Is Different?            Chapter 6 Decoding Neuroscience            Part IIIraising unique (fun, well-rounded, smarter, and happier) kidsChapter 7 How Children Help Create the Differences We See        Chapter 8 Parenting a Stereotype         Chapter 9 Accidentally Shaping Who Children Become        Chapter 10 Stereotype Sneak Attacks        Chapter 11 Separate but Equal?
