magine what it would be like to be made of something different - like lollipops, metal or feathers! With the help of fun rhyming text and amazing illustrations, follow a little boy as his imagination runs wild and he explores what it might be like to breathe underwater or be made entirely of feathers. Although being made of feathers, fluff or sweets might sound amazing, he discovers that everything comes with a catch. He eventually realises that just being yourself is actually the best thing after all. Part of the QED Storytime series, this beautifully illustrated book introduces young children to the pleasures of reading and sharing stories, and includes supporting notes for parents and teachers. Storytime has recently featured on Cbeebies Bedtime Stories.
