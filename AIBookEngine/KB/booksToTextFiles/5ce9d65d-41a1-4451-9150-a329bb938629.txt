Edge is a leveled core reading/language arts program designed for striving  readers and ESL students in grades 9-12. Edge is designed to help prepare  all students for college and career success with dynamic National Geographic  content and authentic and multicultural literature. Edge was built around  relevant and motivating content, preparation for success on the new CCSS  tests, and systematic and focused teaching materials, all while  incorporating and covering the Common Core State Standards. The reading  selections in Edge were specifically chosen to engage adolescent striving  readers, get students excited about reading, and create a context for  discussion and learning. Program authors Alfred Tatum, Michael Smith, and  David Moore have conducted decades of research on how to select literature  that engages and inspires adolescent striving readers as well as incorporate  best, research-based teaching practices to ensure success for all students,  increase reading and comprehension levels, and prepare students for success  beyond the high school classroom. -
