What would you do if you found a baby dinosaur in your oven? This is what happens to Sally and her brother and sister. Sally and Orry, the dinosaur, quickly make friends. But how can the children protect him from the rest of the world?Underlying this story are lessons about taking initiatives and working in a team as well as a few facts about dinosaurs. There is also a good dose of humour as the children, helped by Dr Domuch, try to solve the problem of what to do with Orry.
