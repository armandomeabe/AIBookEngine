This comprehensive examination of extensive reading shows how reading large  quantities of books and other materials can provide students with essential  practice in learning to read as well as help them to develop a positive  attitude towards reading that is sometimes missing in second language  classes. The authors first examine the cognitive and affective nature of  reading and the nature of good reading material, which they term Language  Learner Literature. They then offer practical advice for implementing  extensive reading with second language learners. Suggestions are provided  for integrating extensive reading into the curriculum, establishing a  library, writing and selecting reading material, and keeping records for  purposes of evaluation. The text also describes a wide variety of classroom  activities to supplement individualized silent reading. This book will be  useful for authors of reading material, pre-service teachers, and teachers  and administrators who want to improve the teaching of reading in their  second language programs.
