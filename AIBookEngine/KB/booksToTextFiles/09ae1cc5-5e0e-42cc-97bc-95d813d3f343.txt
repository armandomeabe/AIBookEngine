DescriptionCollins International Primary English offers full coverage of the Cambridge Primary English curriculum framework (0058) from 2020 within a six-level, multi-component course, which has been carefully developed to meet the needs of teachers and students in the international market.Collins International Primary English is a self-contained, cohesive course which develops reading, writing, speaking and listening skills at primary level. The course follows a clear structure and progression through the levels, with carefully selected texts covering both fiction and non-fiction genres, including extracts from the highly successful Collins Big Cat series.The Workbooks offer a range of reading, writing and grammar activities for students of varying language levels to consolidate the language learned in the Student's Books. Following the same topic-based units as the Student's Books, they provide further practice and extension material for learners of all levels. This series also supports Cambridge Global Perspective with activities that develop and practise key skills.This series is endorsed by Cambridge Assessment International Education to support the new curriculum framework 0058 from 2020.
