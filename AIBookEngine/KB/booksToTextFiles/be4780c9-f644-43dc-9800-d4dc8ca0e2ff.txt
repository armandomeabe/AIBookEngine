MYVIEW LITERACY K.4 - STUDENT'S BOOK - SAVVAS   9780768587982myView Literacy English Language Arts Curriculum for Grades K-5 was built to help you reach "lightbulb moments" where your students light up with understanding texts, stories, and language.This unique "workshop model" curriculum addresses literacy, content areas, and social-emotional learning through project-based inquiry (which tackles social studies and science themes). Leveled Readers feature high-interest topics for both guided and independent reading.Each Unit of Study introduces the unit theme and essential question. The weekly sections build to the culminating project-based inquiry activity given at the end of each week. Each lesson features a reading workshop with an infographic, a foundational skill to focus on, a main reading selection in a specific genre (realistic fiction, informational text, poetry, etc.), a reading-writing bridge, and a writing workshop.
