Best selling international author, Isabel Allende tackles her homeland  head-on in this staggering, epic romance. 'Portrait in Sepia' is both a  magnificent historical novel set at the end of the nineteenth century in  Chile and a marvellous family saga peopled by characters from 'Daughter of  Fortune' and 'The House of the Spirits', two of Allende's most celebrated  novels. As a young girl, Aurora del Valle suffered a brutal trauma that has  shaped her character and erased from her mind all recollection of the first  five years of her life. Raised by her ambitious grandmother, the regal and  commanding Paulina del Valle, she grows up in a privileged environment, free  of the limitations that circumscribe the lives of women at that time, but  tormented by terrible nightmares. When she finds herself alone at the end of  an unhappy love affair, she decides to explore the mystery of her past, to  discover what it was, exactly, all those years ago, that had such a  devastating effect on her young life. Richly detailed, epic in scope, this  engrossing story of the dark power of hidden secrets is intimate in its  probing of human character, and thrilling in the way it illuminates the  complexity of family ties.
