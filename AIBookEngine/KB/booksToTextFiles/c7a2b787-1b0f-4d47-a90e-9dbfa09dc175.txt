A delightful new picture word book to share with young children. It is an ideal first introduction to 150 first words carefully selected from themes ranging from the classroom, the hospital, and recycling, to the kitchen, the toy cupboard, and the birthday party. Colourful pages deal with first experiences from playtime, sleepy time, animals and pets, to transport and things that move. Each picture is filled to the brim, and words with pictures are picked out on every page to support children with first literacy skills. A vibrant picture section at the back gives first numbers, colours, shapes, and opposites. Children will be captivated by the lively artwork and a sweet chameleon character - a familiar companion on every page and a link for young readers.
