E. Hinton's The Outsiders and John Knowles's A Separate Peace. After suffering rejection from seven major publishers, The Chocolate War made its debut in 1974, and quickly became a bestselling-and provocative-classic for young adults. This chilling portrait of an all-boys prep school casts an unflinching eye on the pitfalls of conformity and corruption in our most elite cultural institutions."Masterfully structured and rich in theme; the action is well crafted, well timed, suspenseful."-The New York Times Book Review "The characterizations of all the boys are superb."-School Library Journal, starred review"Compellingly immediate. . . .
