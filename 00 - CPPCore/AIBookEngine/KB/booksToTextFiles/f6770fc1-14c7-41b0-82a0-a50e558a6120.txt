While on watch in the crow's nest, the pirate kids spot something gaining on  their ship: a ghost ship! Rotten Tooth refuses to believe them, so the kids  know that they have to solve this mystery themselves. They spend a night on  deck waiting for the ghost ship to approach, and then they plan to board it.  But is it even possible to step onto a ghost ship? And if it is, is it  possible to get off of it?
