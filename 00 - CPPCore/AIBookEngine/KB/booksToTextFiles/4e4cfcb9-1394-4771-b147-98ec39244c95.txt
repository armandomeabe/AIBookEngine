This exciting four-level course is packed with fun activities. Right from  the start, children are fully involved in thinking for themselves, doing  things themselves, and making things themselves.    The topics in the Pupil's Books encourage children to think about the world  around them and, at the higher levels, are linked to other subject areas in  the school curriculum. This approach makes language learning more meaningful  and memorable.     Regular revision pages, and 'I can' sections in the Activity Books allow  children to evaluate their own progress, giving them a real sense of  achievement. The Songs and Stories Audio Cassette/CD can be used in the  classroom or at home and is a fun way of providing extra practice.  Delightfully illustrated Vocabulary Cards are also available to practise the  target language.     The Starter Level, for children in the early stages of literacy, provides a  full year of work and focuses on listening and speaking. Level 1, which can  also be used by complete beginners, is for children who are ready to deal  with all four skills.
