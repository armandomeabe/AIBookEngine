Much Ado About Nothing has long been celebrated as one of Shakespeare's most  popular comedies. The central relationship, between Benedick and Beatrice,  is wittily combative until love prevails. Broader comedy is provided by  Dogberry, Verges and the watchmen. The drama ranges between the  destructively sinister and the lyrically romantic, giving the whole a  complex and sometimes problematic character.
