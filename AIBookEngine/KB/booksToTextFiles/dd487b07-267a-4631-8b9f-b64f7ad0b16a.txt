From photographer Santiago Melazzini, maker of popular flipbooks such as Tango Dancer and I Love You, comes a special four-in-one, full-color flipbook disguised as a stack of $100 bills. Running a thumb over the edges of the "bills" in the stack, the viewer will observe four short, satirical films on the transience of wealth. A recurring cast of characters plays roles based on stereotypes from slapstick silent movies: the wealthy, arrogant high roller; the robber in his prison stripes and domino mask; and the opportunistic showgirl. In a time of financial uncertainty gripping the world, this playful and good-natured item is a reminder that fortunes can change in the blink of an eye, but a sense of humor is an asset that, once possessed, can never be taken away.
