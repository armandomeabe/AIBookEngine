English on the Go! is a brand-new series for upper-primary schools and private language schools that puts students at the centre of the learning process and develops cognitive as well as social and emotional skills. Students are constantly stimulated to work with both printed and digital pedagogical resources in an integrated manner, magnifying learning opportunities and fostering their autonomy. The series applies active learning principles and gives learners the tools they need to act as protagonists in their communities and in the 21st-century world.
