Beware! Dangerous secrets lie between the pages of this book. OK, I warned  you. But if you think I'll give anything away, or tell you that this is the  sequel to my first literary endeavor, The Name of This Book is Secret,  you're wrong. I'm not going to remind you of how we last left our heroes,  Cass and Max-Ernest, as they awaited intiation into the mysterious Terces  Society, or the ongoing fight against the evil Dr. L and Ms. Mauvais. I  certainly won't be telling you about how the kids stumble upon the Museum of  Magic, where they finally meet the amazing Pietro! Oh, blast! I've done it  again. Well, at least I didn't tell you about the missing Sound Prism, the  nefarious Lord Pharaoh, or the mysterious creature born in a bottle over 500  years ago, the key to the biggest secret of all. I really can't help myself,  now can I? Let's face it---if you're reading this, it's too late.
