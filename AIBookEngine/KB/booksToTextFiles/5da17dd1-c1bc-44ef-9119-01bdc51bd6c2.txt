What better way is there to learn than by doing? This unusual book enables children to carry out more than 40 experiments and demonstrations, carefully planned to illustrate important principles of modern science. Clear step-by-step instructions, frequent diagrams, and clear statements of conclusions all enable the young student to carry through these experiments with minimal supervision, yet full success.Before embarking on the world of discovery, the reader is introduced to the language of chemistry, including a list of the most common elements and their symbols. A chapter on setting up a laboratory, with a list of equipment and chemicals is also very helpful, as is a discussion of laboratory techniques.The experiments focus on the chemicals in the air; the chemistry of water; solutions, diffusion, and osmosis; crystals; fire; acids, bases and salts; photography, and everyday things. The experiments included demonstrate how to grow a crystal garden, make oxygen five different ways, measure the proportion of oxygen in air, bleach cloth, and make soap and toothpaste. No special equipment is needed: apparatus can for the most part be made at home, and the materials are readily available, inexpensive household items, or are easily found at the pharmacy.This volume offers upper grade school, junior high school, and high school students a very entertaining way to enrich their background in science and its applications. It is also a very valuable aid to parents, teachers, and others who wish to make clear, forceful demonstrations to children.
