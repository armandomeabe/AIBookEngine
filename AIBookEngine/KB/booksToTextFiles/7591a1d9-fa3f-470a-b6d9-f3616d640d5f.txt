It seems like a dream come  true...until they're hunted by the world's nastiest villains.     Max returns in a chilling adventure unlike any other. Safe havens for the  six highly-sought-after winged kids have become increasingly hard to find,  so the flock takes refuge in Antarctica with a team of environmentalists  studying the effects of global warming. In this remote wilderness--whether  pursued by corrupt governments, bioengineered bad-guys, or the harsh forces  of nature--survival of the fittest takes a new twist!
