A SCIENTIST'S CASE FOR THE AFTERLIFE  Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have  argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those  scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel  real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.    Then, Dr. Alexander's own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of  the brain that controls thought and emotion-and in essence makes us  human-shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his  doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander's eyes popped open. He had  come back.    Alexander's recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story  lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this  world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest  realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine  source of the universe itself.    Alexander's story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he  could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven,  God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health  can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that  death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.    This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it  happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of  faith will be able to ignore it. Reading it will change your life.
