CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS AND THE PERILOUS PLOT OF PROFESSOR POOPYPANTSThe fourth Captain Underpants adventure like you've never seen it before: in full color!Professor Pippy P. Poopypants may well be the greatest scientific genius the world has ever known. Unfortunately, he has such a silly name that nobody takes him seriously! He's been laughed out of every university in the world.In fact, the only place that'll hire him is Jerome Horwitz Elementary School. Professor Poopypants is certain that schoolchildren would never laugh at his name. "Kids are so accepting and loving," he assures himself. And it's really important that nobody laughs at his name, or makes a comic book about him, or makes jokes about him in any way. Because if one more person does, Professor Pippy P. Poopypants might just fly into a frenzied rage and take over the planet with his brilliantly wild and evil inventions!Watch out, kids! The amazing Captain Underpants is about to meet his match!
