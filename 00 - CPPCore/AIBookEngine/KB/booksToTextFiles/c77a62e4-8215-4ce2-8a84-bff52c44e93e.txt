Inevitably, it is in the most commonly used languages that the vocabulary of  language testing and assessment is most highly developed, and for which most  of the literature has been produced. A multilingual glossary has a  significant role to play in encouraging the development of language testing  in less widely taught languages. The idea of producing a multilingual  glossary of assessment and language testing terms has grown out of the needs  experienced by members of the Association of Language Testers in Europe  (ALTE) while engaged in work on language testing projects. It is anticipated  that this glossary will be of use, not only to members of ALTE, but to many  others working in the context of European languages, who are involved in  language testing and assessment. The glossary contains entries in ten  languages: Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, Italian,  Portuguese and Spanish.
