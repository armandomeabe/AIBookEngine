Introduction and Notes by Norman Vance, Professor of English, University of  Sussex     Far from the Madding Crowd is perhaps the most pastoral of Hardy's Wessex  novels. It tells the story of the young farmer Gabriel Oak and his love for  and pursuit of the elusive Bathsheba Everdene, whose wayward nature leads  her to both tragedy and true love. It tells of the dashing Sergeant Troy  whose rakish philosophy of life was '...the past was yesterday; never, the  day after'. And lastly, of the introverted and reclusive gentleman farmer,  Mr Boldwood, whose love fills him with '...a fearful sense of exposure',  when he first sets eyes on Bathsheba. The background of this tale is the  Wessex countryside in all its moods.
