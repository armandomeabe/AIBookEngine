Meet classic comic-strip character Big Nate -- The Boy with the Biggest Head  in the World -- as he stars in his own super-funny series. Big Nate is  created by Lincoln Peirce, who inspired Jeff Kinney, author of DIARY OF A  WIMPY KID. Big-head Nate Wright truly believes he is destined for greatness!  He's a table tennis champ, a genius comic book artist and the  self-proclaimed king of his class. One school morning, Nate barely survives  his Dad's toxic porridge before rushing off to school, forgetting his lunch.  He thinks he has a test and he hasn't studied for it! Nate's class notes are  full of doodles but sadly lacking any useful information! On the way to  school he accidentally body slams his head teacher, then, during his first  lesson of the day, he manages to insult his least favourite teacher, Mrs.  Godfrey (aka Godzilla). But a little thing like having-the-worst-day-ever  won't hold back The Boy with the Biggest Head in the World!
