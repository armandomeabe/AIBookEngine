This revised second edition updates a course which has proven to be a  perfect fit for classes the world over. This Testmaker Audio CD/CD-ROM gives  teachers the flexibility to create and edit their own tests. It is extremely  easy to use while also offers a range of functionality for those who like to  customize more.     Teachers can choose from unit tests, which can be combined in pairs, and  end-of-year tests. There are also options to test the same course content at  both 'standard' and 'more challenging' levels. The Testmaker can produce two  versions of each test to prevent students from sharing answers.    This disc contains all the audio required for test listening components.
