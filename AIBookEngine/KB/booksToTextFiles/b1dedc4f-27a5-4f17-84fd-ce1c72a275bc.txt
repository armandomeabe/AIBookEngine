Gary Sinise's reading of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is nothing short  of magnificent. Moving effortlessly from an eloquent, understated narrative  voice to each character's quite particular presence, Sinise demonstrates a  true command of the medium. At times, Sinise is so convincing that one is  hard-pressed to believe that a single reader could be responsible for so  many varied characterizations. Thanks to such a skilled reading, this audio  edition captures every nuance of Steinbeck's austere prose and the full  power of the novel's tragic denouement. Top to bottom, it's a masterful  retelling of an American classic. R.W.B. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine  --This text refers to the Audio Cassette edition.
