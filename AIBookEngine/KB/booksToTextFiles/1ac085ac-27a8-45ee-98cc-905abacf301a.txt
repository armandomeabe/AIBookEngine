Here are two new split-page board books in the popular series from Eric Carle. In the brilliantly colorful My Very First Book of Animal Homes, children can match each animal with the home it lives in. Where do the bees live? Where does the bird live? In My Very First Book of Animal Sounds, children can match each animal with the sound it makes. Which animal barks? Which animal roars? Only you can match them. Full of vibrant animals, these books are loads of fun for young children.
