Phineas Taylor "P. T." Barnum (1810–91) is best known for forming the circus that came to be known as The Greatest Show on Earth. A brash, larger-than-life entrepreneur, he transformed the nature of commercial entertainment in the nineteenth century, from his private museum of curiosities to his big-top extravaganzas. Towards the end of his illustrious career, the renowned showman shared the secrets to his success in The Art of Money Getting or, Golden Rules for Making Money.As relevant today as it was upon its 1880 publication, this guide to prosperity offers practical advice rather than get-rich-quick schemes. Barnum asserts that there are no shortcuts to affluence; instead, he stresses the importance of virtue as a foundation for wealth. His suggestions for the development of character and for cultivating habits that will insure financial security range from choosing the right vocation and avoiding debt to preserving integrity and maintaining courtesy. If you follow the proven advice within, you will establish economic habits that will not only bring financial security, but also a rewarding sense of delight and satisfaction throughout your life. Barnum’s energy as a showman remains alive on the pages as he takes the reader through colorful, entertaining stories to emphasize and bring home his points.
