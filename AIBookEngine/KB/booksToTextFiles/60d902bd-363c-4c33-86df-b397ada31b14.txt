THE BADDIES"Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler are the Lennon and McCartney of children's publishing"Sunday TimesThe brand-new picture book from superstar author and illustrator Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler is a riot of slapstick fun and silliness. The Baddies are the meanest, nastiest ghost, witch and troll in the land. They just adore being bad, and fight over who is the worst.When a little girl moves into a nearby cottage, the Baddies can't wait to scare her out of her wits.But the little girl quickly shows them that you don't have to be big to be brave, and baddies don't always win.Perfect read-aloud rhyming text and stunning pictures on every page with lots of details to spot.Julia and Axel are the team that have created picture book favourites such as The Gruffalo, Stick Man, Zog and Highway Rat - all of which have been made into animated films premiering on BBC1 Christmas Day.The Smeds and the Smoos animation debuted on BBC1 Christmas 2022 with voice artists including Bill Bailey (comedian and Strictly winner), Adjoa Andoh (Bridgerton), Sally Hawkins (Paddington movies) and Rob Brydon (Gavin and Stacey).Edad recomendada: A partir de 6 a√±os.
