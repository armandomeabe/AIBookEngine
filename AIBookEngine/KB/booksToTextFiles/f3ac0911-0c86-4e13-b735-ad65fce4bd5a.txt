BE WHO YOU AREBe old. Be young.Speak your language.Be proud of where you're from.Just BE WHO YOU ARE!Who better than Todd Parr to remind kids that their unique traits are what make them so special? With nods to everything from race to gender expression to economic background, Todd offers a 2016 twist on the themes that made his all-time best-selling book It's Okay to Be Different such a beloved classic.Todd's collection of work occupies a unique space in the children's book market, addressing topics in a way that feels wholly necessary, inclusive, and appropriate with a sensibility that's wacky, kid-friendly, and fun. The time is right for a book about acceptance in all forms, and we have no doubt this will resonate with many fans new and old.Edad recomendada: Adultos.
