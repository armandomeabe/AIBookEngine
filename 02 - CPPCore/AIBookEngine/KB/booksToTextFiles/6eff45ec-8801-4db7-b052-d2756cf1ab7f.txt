The Essential Mathematics for Cambridge Lower Secondary series has been created for the international student. Written by an expert author team with an experienced examiner, it provides complete coverage of the Cambridge syllabus. Providing comprehensive, clear theory notes followed by worked examples, the text helps students apply the knowledge they have learnt. Learning Outcomes are provided at the start of each chapter to clearly map topics in the text to the syllabus. Numerous exercises are included, with clear progression, and problem-solving and real life applications embedded throughout. End-of-topic and end-of-section questions are designed to assess understanding, not only of the current topic but also of the ways in which different topics might be combined in examinations.
