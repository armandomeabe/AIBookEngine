Review: "The book sums up what Cambridge IGCSE expects of its candidates and it would help the teachers to prepare the students fully for the examination. I particularly like the exam corner pages as they give students exam type exercises that allow the students to see their mistakes." T. Ndlovu, Falcon College, Zimbabwe.
