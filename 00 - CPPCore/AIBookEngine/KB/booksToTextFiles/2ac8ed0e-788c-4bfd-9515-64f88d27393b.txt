A big novel about a small town...    When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is  left in shock.    Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an  ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty facade is a town at war.    Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war  with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils...Pagford is not what  it first seems.    And the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the  catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an  election fraught with passion, duplicity, and unexpected revelations?    A big novel about a small town, The Casual Vacancy is J.K. Rowling's first  novel for adults.
