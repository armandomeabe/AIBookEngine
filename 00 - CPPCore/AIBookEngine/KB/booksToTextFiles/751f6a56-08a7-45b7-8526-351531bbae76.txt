Settled in at her new school and flanked by awesome friends Chloe and Zoey,  life is looking up for Nikki Maxwell, especially since her crush, Brandon,  asked her to be his lab partner-a seriously awesome development. However,  when Nikki overhears mean girl Mackenzie bragging that Brandon's taking her  to the Halloween dance, a bummed Nikki signs on to spend Halloween at a  kids' party with her little sister, Brianna, instead. After she finds out  Mackenzie was lying and her dream of going to the party with Brandon could  be a reality, Nikki has two events to juggle . . . plus plenty of other  entertaining trials and tribulations along the way!
