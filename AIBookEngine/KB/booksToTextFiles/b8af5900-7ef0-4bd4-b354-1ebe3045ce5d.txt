MEMOIRS OF A DUTIFUL DAUGHTER"[Beauvoir's] graciously written memoirs carry distinct appeal in recording the emotional and intellectual birth pangs of a fascinating woman." -TimeA superb autobiography by one of the great literary figures of the twentieth century, Simone de Beauvoir's Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter offers an intimate picture of growing up in a bourgeois French family, rebelling as an adolescent against the conventional expectations of her class, and striking out on her own with an intellectual and existential ambition exceedingly rare in a young woman in the 1920s.Beauvoir vividly evokes her friendships, love interests, mentors, and the early days of the most important relationship of her life, with fellow student Jean-Paul Sartre, against the backdrop of a turbulent political time.SIMONE DE BEAUVOIRSimone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir (9 January 1908 - 14 April 1986) was a French existentialist philosopher, writer, social theorist, and feminist activist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, nor was she considered one at the time of her death, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.Edad recomendada: Adultos.
