Messages is a four-level course for lower-secondary students. There are 6  modules of 2 units per level, each divided into 3 manageable steps. Clear  aims and outcomes for each step mean students can put what they learn into  practice immediately.     Each level of the course provides 80-90 hours of classwork with lots of  recycling in regular four-page review sections. Level 1 assumes students  have studied English at primary school, but gives full coverage of all basic  language areas. The course takes students to an intermediate level by the  end of Level 4.    An EAL (English as an Additional Language) Teacher's Resource CD-ROM is now  available for use with level 1.
