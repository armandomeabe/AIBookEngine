Beowulf is the greatest surviving work of literature in Old English,  unparalleled in its epic scale and scope. It tells the story of the heroic  Beowulf and of his battles, first with the monster Grendel, who has laid  waste to the great hall of the Danish king Hrothgar, then with Grendel√Øs  avenging mother and finally with a dragon that is devastating his homeland.  Through its blend of history, legend and myth, Beowulf vividly evokes a  twilight  world in which men and supernatural forces live side by side, and  celebrates the endurance of the human spirit in a transient world.
