The year is 1547. In London, two boys from different families live very  different lives. One is Edward Tudor, a prince and the future King of  England; the other is Tom Canty, the son of a thief. One day they meet and  their lives change forever.     What happens when the two boys wear each other's clothes? Why does the  prince need the help of a poor man? Who becomes king when Henry VIII dies?  And how can a beautiful gold object save the prince? Mark Twain's classic  story of two young boys who swap lives has the answers.
