Collaborative Action Research for English Language Teachers proposes that  action research should be a collaborative process emerging from the  practical concerns of groups of teachers working in a common or similar  context. Teachers' first-person accounts provide the basis for exploring the  challenges and constraints of action research. Collaborative Action Research  for English Language Teachers discusses: what collaborative action research  is and why it is of interest to classroom teachers; processes and steps in  collaborative action research; methods for data collection that integrate  with classroom activities and ways of analysing action research data. It  will be of interest to teachers seeking new directions for their own  professional development as well as to teacher educators, program  administrators and researchers interested in integrating collaborative  action research into current practice and curriculum renewal.
