Grade 3-5-Kimmel presents the legendary story of the part-husky/part-wolf  sled dog that braved severe blizzard conditions to take antitoxin serum to a  remote Alaskan village in 1925. When the town was stricken by a diphtheria  epidemic, Balto overcame unbelievable obstacles to accomplish what other  dogs could not. This heroic canine has been immortalized in statue, film,  and now in a book that brings his story to life. Kimmel's writing deftly  combines geography, sled racing, and historical background with the gripping  adventure of Balto's race to save lives. In many ways, the book reads like  fast-paced fiction. Koerber's service- able black-and-white illustrations  appear throughout and reflect the action. Sure to appeal to beginning  chapter-book readers.
