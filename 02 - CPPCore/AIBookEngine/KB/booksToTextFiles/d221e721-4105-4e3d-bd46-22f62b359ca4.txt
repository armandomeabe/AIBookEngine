Fifty-eight of the fables attributed to Aesop are given a fresh and totally  inviting look here. In retelling the tales, Gatti uses spare but evocative  language and includes the requisite moral for each. Many of Aesop's  best-loved selections are included, but quite a few equally clever, if  lesser known, fables find their way into this collection. Great attention  has been paid to the arrangement of type, and both text and illustrations  are beautifully reproduced on a heavy white paper stock. Employing a style  reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts and Persian miniatures, Salter excels  in the decorative aspect of her work. Detailed borders surround the stylized  animal characters and enrich each story. Executed in gouache, the paintings  are most successful when occupying a full page. The smaller paintings are  attractive but lack the detail found in the larger ones. The colors are a  pleasing mix of earthy brown, red, and green. While many versions exist,  this book's artwork sets it apart.
