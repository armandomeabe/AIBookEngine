Fans of Tomie dePaola's kindly Strega Nona will love this charming look at  the early days of her good-hearted but clumsy helper Big Anthony. From the  day he is born, Big Anthony never pays attention. As a boy, he leaves the  gates of the farm open and all the animals escape. As a young man off to  make his fortune in the world, he accidentally "fixes" the leaning Tower of  Pisa. Will Italy survive the hilarious mishaps of Big Anthony?
