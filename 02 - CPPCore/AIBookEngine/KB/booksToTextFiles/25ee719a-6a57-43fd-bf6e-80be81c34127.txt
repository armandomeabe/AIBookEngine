The English Plus Workbook provides plenty of carefully planned practice to build students' confidence whatever their ability and also includes access to the Workbook audio and online Practice Kit.The Workbook includes exercises in grammar, vocabulary and skills, which mirror the language and skills work in the Student's Book pages. There are three levels of practice activities: one-star activities provide basic revision and language manipulation; two-star activities involve more productive exercises; and three-star activities are more open and offer more challenge. There is a two-page Progress review at the end of each unit. These exercises check understanding of all the vocabulary, grammar and skills presented in the unit. They also provide a record of what has been learned in the unit. The Self-evaluation section encourages students to think about their progress. This type of activity is also very helpful in students' development as learners because it encourages them to take responsibility for their own learning. There is a listening exercise in every Progress review. The audio for this is available on the online Practice Kit.
