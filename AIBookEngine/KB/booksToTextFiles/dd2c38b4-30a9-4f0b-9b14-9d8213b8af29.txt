This volume explores how a second language is acquired and what learners  must do in order to achieve proficiency. The paperback edition is a  collection of original essays that approaches second language acquisition  from a linguistic rather than a sociological, psychological, or purely  pedagogical perspective. A wide range of viewpoints and approaches is  represented. The essays in this book provide an incisive analysis of how a  second language is acquired and what the second language learner must do  mentally to achieve proficiency in another language. The chapters are  arranged topically from those covering the broad area of theories of  acquisition to those focusing specifically on syntax, semantics, pragmatics,  lexicon, and phonology in another language.
