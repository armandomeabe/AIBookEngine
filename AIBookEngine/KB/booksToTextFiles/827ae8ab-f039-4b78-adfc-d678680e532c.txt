See the world of Fifty Shades of Grey anew through the eyes of Christian  Grey.    In Christian's own words, and through his thoughts, reflections, and dreams,  E L James offers a fresh perspective on the love story that has enthralled  millions of readers around the world.    Christian Grey exercises control in all things; his world is neat,  disciplined, and utterly empty-until the day that Anastasia Steele falls  into his office, in a tangle of shapely limbs and tumbling brown hair. He  tries to forget her, but instead is swept up in a storm of emotion he cannot  comprehend and cannot resist. Unlike any woman he has known before, shy,  unworldly Ana seems to see right through him-past the business prodigy and  the penthouse lifestyle to Christian's cold, wounded heart.
