Annie Ferguson was a bright young Manhattan architect with a limitless  future-until a single phone call changed the course of her life forever.  Overnight, she became the mother to her sister's three orphaned children,  keeping a promise she never regretted making, even if it meant putting her  own life indefinitely on hold.     Now, at forty-two, still happily single with a satisfying career and a  family that means everything to her, Annie is suddenly facing an empty nest.  With her nephew and nieces now grown and confronting challenges of their  own, she must navigate a parent's difficult passage between helping and  letting go. The eldest, twenty-eight-year-old Liz, an overworked editor in a  high-powered job at Vogue, has never allowed any man to come close enough to  hurt her. Ted, at twenty-four a serious law student, is captivated by a much  older woman with children, who is leading him much further than he wants to  go. And the impulsive youngest, twenty-one-year old Katie, is an art student  about to make a choice that will lead her to a world she is in no way  prepared for but determined to embrace.    Then, when least expected, a chance encounter changes Annie's life again in  the most surprising direction of all. . . .
