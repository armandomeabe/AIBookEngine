Keep it REAL! really is your best option for a modern secondary course for today's teenagers. Students focus on developing communicative competence and 21st century skills, with this flexible blend of dynamic video and digital content, and easy-to-use classroom materials. As students develop their grammar, vocabulary and speaking, we help you manage skills development in mixed ability classes, too. The course also focuses on culture, with optional project-based work, literature lessons and common exam task practice. Student's BookA Starter Unit reviews previous language, before nine units develop language skills alongside vocabulary and grammar: Vocabulary opens with a real-life vlog; then grammar is presented through a reading text, with explanatory grammar animations; and a listening activity combines further vocabulary and grammar. Keep Talking!, the functional speaking lesson, uses authentic contexts in an innovative, highly-interactive online game. Students read about Real Culture!, watching a related video, then explore specific text types in a final writing lesson. They can extend their learning through project work, literature, and exam practice at the back of their books, where they can also refer to unit Language Summaries.
