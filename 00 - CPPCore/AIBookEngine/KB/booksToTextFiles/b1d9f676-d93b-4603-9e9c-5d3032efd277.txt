RAMONA QUIMBY, AGE 8From the first day of third grade, when Ramona Quimby meets her eventual  nemesis Yard Ape, life moves on at its usual wild pace--usual for the  boisterous Ramona, that is. Soon she is accidentally squashing a raw egg  into her hair at the school cafeteria, being forced to play Uncle Rat with  her annoying young neighbor, and, worst of all, throwing up in her  classroom. The responsibilities of an 8-year-old are sometimes daunting,  especially in a family that is trying to squeak by while the father goes  back to school. But Ramona is full of too much vim and vigor to ever be down for long.BEVERLY CLEARYBeverly Cleary is one of America's most beloved authors. As a child, she struggled with reading and writing. But by third grade, after spending much time in her public library in Portland, Oregon, she found her skills had greatly improved. Before long, her school librarian was saying that she should write children's books when she grew up.Instead she became a librarian. When a young boy asked her, "Where are the books about kids like us?" she remembered her teacher's encouragement and was inspired to write the books she'd longed to read but couldn't find when she was younger. She based her funny stories on her own neighborhood experiences and the sort of children she knew. And so, the Klickitat Street gang was born!Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, presented to her in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. Dear Mr. Henshaw won the Newbery Medal, and Ramona Quimby, Age 8 and Ramona and Her Father have been named Newbery Honor Books. Her characters, including Beezus and Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ralph, the motorcycle-riding mouse, have delighted children for generations.Edad recomendada: A partir de 8 a√±os.
