Julius Caesar is among the best of Shakespeare's historical and political  plays. Dealing with events surrounding the assassination of Julius Caesar in  44 B.C., the drama vividly illustrates the ways in which power and  corruption are linked.    The cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!' is used to exculpate brutal realities,  while personal ambitions taint public actions. Rich in characterisation and  replete with eloquent rhetoric, Julius Caesar remains engrossing and  topical: a play for today.
