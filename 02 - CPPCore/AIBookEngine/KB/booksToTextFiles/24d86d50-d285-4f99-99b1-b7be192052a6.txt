Interactive is an exciting four-level course for teenage learners from  elementary to upper-intermediate levels (CEF A2-B2). The Level 3 Student's  Book will get and keep your students talking, using real, contemporary  English. 'Interaction' sections give learners the confidence to use English  in real-life situations and a fold-out classroom language reference on the  cover provides students with the phrases they need for speaking activities.  'Skills4Real' sections, 'Culture UK' noticeboards and 'Culture World'  magazines practise skills using authentic reading material, and unscripted  listenings, with activities and projects to put this language into practice.  Also included is a graphic novel which makes reading fun, and an access code  for online Student's Zone games and activities.
