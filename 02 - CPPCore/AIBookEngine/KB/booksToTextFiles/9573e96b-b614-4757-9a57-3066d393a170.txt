Exam Essentials is our major British English exam preparation series  combining exam preparation, practice, and tips for the revised Cambridge  English exams. This effective combination of testing and teaching has proved  a popular formula with teachers and students. The first two practice tests  in each book are 'walk-through' tests. Students are carefully guided through  the tests and shown how they work and what they have to do to succeed in  each part of the exam. Additional step-by-step support for the Writing paper  is offered in all the tests.     All of the tests are written by experts in the field, which means that  students preparing for the exams experience material that is appropriate for  and at a level at least as high as the actual exams. -
