As educational and information driven as its predecessor, New Challenges  offers new interactive components, new strong themes and photo stories, and  a lighter, which makes it a more manageable pathway from primary to  secondary.     New Challenges helps students become more effective learners and better  citizens of the world. Through stimulating and engaging contexts and lively  achievable tasks, New Challenges encourages young teens to think about the  world around them and builds their confidence to participate, create, and  perform.
