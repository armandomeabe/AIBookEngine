A classic tale by Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo, America's beloved storytellerOnce, in a house on Egypt Street, there lived a china rabbit named Edward Tulane. The rabbit was very pleased with himself, and for good reason: he was owned by a girl named Abilene, who adored him completely. And then, one day, he was lost. . . . Kate DiCamillo takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the depths of the ocean to the net of a fisherman, from the bedside of an ailing child to the bustling streets of Memphis. Along the way, we are shown a miracle - that even a heart of the most breakable kind can learn to love, to lose, and to love again.Featuring black-and-white illustrations and a refreshed cover by Bagram Ibatoulline.
