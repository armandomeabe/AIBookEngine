This is a volume of original essays on key aspects of John Searle's  philosophy of language. It examines Searle's work in relation to current  issues of central significance, including internalism versus externalism  about mental and linguistic content, truth-conditional versus  non-truth-conditional conceptions of content, the relative priorities of  thought and language in the explanation of intentionality, the status of the  distinction between force and sense in the theory of meaning, the issue of  meaning scepticism in relation to rule-following, and the proper  characterization of 'what is said' in relation to the semantics/pragmatics  distinction. Written by a distinguished team of contemporary philosophers,  and prefaced by an illuminating essay by Searle, the volume aims to  contribute to a deeper understanding of Searle's work in philosophy of  language, and to suggest innovative approaches to fundamental questions in  that area.
