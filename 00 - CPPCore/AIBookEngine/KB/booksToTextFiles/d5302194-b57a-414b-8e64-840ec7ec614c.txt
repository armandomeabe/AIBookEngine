Anna Metcalfe's stories are about communication and miscommunication - between characters and across cultures. Whether about a blithely entitled English teacher in a poor Beijing school, an immigrant female taxi driver in Paris, or a young Chinese girl spouting made-up Confucian phrases to please tourists, the stories examine the assumptions we make about other people, and about ourselves.Blind Water Pass is an auspicious debut by a superb young writer.
