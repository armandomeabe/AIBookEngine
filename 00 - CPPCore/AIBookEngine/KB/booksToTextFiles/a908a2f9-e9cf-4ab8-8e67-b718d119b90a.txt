Introduction and Notes by Dr Adrienne Gavin, Canterbury Christ Church  University College    Illustrations by Hablot K. Browne (Phiz)    Dickens wrote of David Copperfield: 'Of all my books I like this the best'.  Millions of readers in almost every language on earth have subsequently come  to share the author's own enthusiasm for this greatly loved classic,  possibly because of its autobiographical form. Following the life of David  through many sufferings and great adversity, the reader will also find many  light-hearted moments in the company of a host of English fiction's greatest  stars including Mr Micawber, Traddles, Uriah Heep, Creakle, Betsy Trotwood,  and the Peggoty family.
