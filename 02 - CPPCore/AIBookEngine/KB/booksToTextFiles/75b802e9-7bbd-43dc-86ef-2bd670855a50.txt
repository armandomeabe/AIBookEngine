Charles Strickland, a conventional stockbroker, abandons his wife and  children for Paris and Tahiti, to live his life as a painter. Whilst his  betrayal of family, duty and honour gives him the freedom to achieve  greatness, his decision leads to an obsession which carries severe  implications. Inspired by the life of Paul Gauguin, The Monn and Sixpence is  at once a satiric caricature of Edwardian conventions and vivid portrayal of  the mentality of a genius.
