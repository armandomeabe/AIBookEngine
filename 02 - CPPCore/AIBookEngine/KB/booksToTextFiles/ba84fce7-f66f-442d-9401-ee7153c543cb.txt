While explaining "how the Romantic generation discovered the beauty and  terror of science," Richard Holmes focuses on what "became the first great  age of the public scientific lecture, the laboratory demonstration and the  introductory textbook, often written by women. It was the age when science  began to be taught to children, and the Å xperimental method' became the  basis of a new, secular philosophy of life, in which the infinite wonders of  Creation (whether divine or not) were increasingly valued for their own  sake...Finally, it was the age which challenged the elite monopoly of the  Royal Society, and saw the foundation of scores of new scientific  institutions, mechanics institutes and `philosophical' societies."
