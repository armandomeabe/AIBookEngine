He is fae.Part of the powerful and magical people who are said to have abandoned this world entirely three hundred years ago.But here one stands before me. And when he turns his onyx eyes upon me, I fall captive.For an entirely different reason.As his army march towards a battle with the king I once adored, I must decide.Midas or Rip.Loyalty or freedom.In this game of war and love, it's my turn to choose.
