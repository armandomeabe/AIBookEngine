THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS This months-long New York Times bestseller is "irresistible.seductive.with a  high concept plot that keeps you riveted from the first page," (O, The Oprah  Magazine).    After four harrowing years on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns to  Australia and takes a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly  half a day's journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the  supply boat comes once a season, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife,  Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving  Isabel hears a baby's cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore  carrying a dead man and a living baby.    Tom, who keeps meticulous records and whose moral principles have withstood  a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel  insists the baby is a "gift from God," and against Tom's judgment, they  claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel  return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the  world. Their choice has devastated one of them.
