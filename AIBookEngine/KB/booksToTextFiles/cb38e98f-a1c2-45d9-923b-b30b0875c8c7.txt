Aron Ralston has always lived for  adventure, but on a hiking trip in Utah,  he has a seroius accident. As he climbs  across a canyon, a boulder falls and traps  his right arm against the canyon wall. For  six days, Aron is trapped. No one knows  where he is and he has very little food or  water. As timeruns out, Aron has to make  a terrible decision: to amputate his own  arm.
