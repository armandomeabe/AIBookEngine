FLORA AND THE CHICKSA distinctive counting book with fold-out pages that builds on the spirit and success of Caldecott Honor Winner Flora and the Flamingo and the subsequent books in the series. When a nest of eggs begins to hatch, how will Flora ever keep up with so many chicks? This adorable book featuring the darling, dancing Flora will delight young children as they master new words, concepts, and dance moves! These new additions to the publishing programme engage with the same great themes around friendship, performance, body language, choreography and making mistakes. They have a similar aesthetic, with thoughtful shapes, classic typefaces, and wordless content, as well as strong production values and innovative bookmaking.Edad recomendada: A partir de 3 a√±os.
