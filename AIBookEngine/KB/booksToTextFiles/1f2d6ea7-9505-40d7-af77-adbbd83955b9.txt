GRAMMAR IN USE, based on the new Secondary  English Language Syllabus 2001,  is a series of four workbooks that uses text types as an organizational  feature. The passages illustrate specific grammar items in authentic  contexts, followed by exercises that provide students with practice in  natural spoken or written English.      Other useful features are included to meet the current learning requirement  in secondary school such as:    *MINI-PROJECTS are included at end of each unit to meet the current learning  requirement in school*  *GO ONLINE gives relevant websites that will help students use the internet  in their learning*  *LANGUAGE NOTES provide essential explanation on target grammar item*
