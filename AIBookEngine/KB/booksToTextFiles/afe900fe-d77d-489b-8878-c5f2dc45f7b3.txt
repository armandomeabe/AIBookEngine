Kim is Rudyard Kipling's finest work. Now controversial, this novel is a  memorably vivid evocation of the life and landscapes of India in the late  nineteenth century. Kim himself is a resourceful lad who befriends a lama,  an ageing priest; and both embark on a combined quest. Whereas Kim has an  insatiable interest in the varied activities around him, the lama seeks  redemption from the 'Wheel of Life'. Kim becomes involved in the 'Great  Game', undertaking espionage for the British rulers.  This engrossing and moving novel, with its diversity of memorable  characters, offers many insights into political, religious and social  tensions.
