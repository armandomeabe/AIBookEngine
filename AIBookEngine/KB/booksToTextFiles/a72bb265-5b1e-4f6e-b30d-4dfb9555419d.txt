From the creator of Disney's Dog with a Blog, this funny book in the Betty  Bunny series shows the value of honesty from a preschooler's special point  of view.     When Betty Bunny breaks a lamp, she has a brand-new idea: Blame it on  someone else (like the Tooth Fairy)! Then a vase gets broken and Betty Bunny  really didn't do it. But now no one in her family believes her. Honest lies,  white lies, crying wolf-how can one four-year-old figure out the right thing  to do?
