This fourth edition updated for the 2018 revised exams, provides bright, full-colour and interactive preparation for the Cambridge English: Young Learners (YLE) Tests. Fun activities balanced with exam-style questions practise all the areas of the syllabus in a communicative way. The material is specifically designed to focus on those areas most likely to cause problems for young learners at these levels. Each unit forms the basis for a lesson of 75 to 90 minutes. The learning management system includes interactive online resources - fun games and activities - which practise the language covered in the Student's Books. A Home Fun Booklet allows students to practice vocabulary at home and helps parents support learning. Visit worldoffun.cambridge.org for samples of each level as well as lots of teaching tips and resources for the revised 2018 Cambridge English: Young Learners.
