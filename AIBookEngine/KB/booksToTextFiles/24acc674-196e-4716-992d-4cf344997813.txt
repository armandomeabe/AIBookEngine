Written by an award-winning author of science books for children, this engrossing book enables youngsters (ages 7 to 13) to do 38 safe experiments at home or in the classroom with such common items as a teaspoon and saucer, paper towels, aspirin, baking powder, plastic straws, vinegar, and rubbing alcohol.The language of the text is clear enough for grade-school children yet is consistently (and technically) accurate and informative. Directions for simple experiments describe how to write "invisible messages" with home-made phenolphthalein, how to clean pennies with salt and vinegar, how to break aspirin into its components and how to perform a variety of other experiments involving carbonates and acids, precipitates, crystals, emulsions, catalysts, hydrogen, copper plating, chemical indicators, color flame tests, and much more.Easy-to-follow instructions, accompanied by abundant and clearly detailed illustrations, distinguish a book which not only provides children with fun-filled scientific challenges, but also serves as a valuable aid to parents, teachers, and other adults working with youngsters interested in science.
