It's a long way toa million, right?Of course it is.But do you really knowwhat a million looks like?If you'd like to see -- actually see, right now, with your own eyes -- what a million looks like, just open this book.Be prepared to learn some interesting things along the way.Like how many shoe boxes it would take to make a stack to Mount Everest.And be prepared to do some number wondering of your own.But, most of all, be prepared to be amazed.Because a million is a LOT of dots.
