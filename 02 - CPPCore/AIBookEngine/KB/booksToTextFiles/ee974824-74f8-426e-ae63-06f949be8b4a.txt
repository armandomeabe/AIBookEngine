Travel to a range of different animal kingdoms in this second series of Animal Diaries. From the hot savannah plains of Africa to the freezing cold South Pole, from soaring in the sky to living near a pond, each diary is an amazing insight into an animal's life.This series' unique approach is that the diaries are not written by a human, but by the animals themselves, charting their lives from birth to maturity with all the adventures that happen in between.Each book is a mixture of diary entries, informative extracts, sketches and fact-filled animal profile cards. Books are packed full of interesting information on the animals' habitat, diet, different stages of life and interaction with other animals.Incredibly vivid illustrations let young readers feel like they are immersed in the lives of the diarists, and may encourage them to start documenting their own adventures.
