This volume presents a union of theoretical and practical pedagogical  perspectives on materials design and development. This volume provides an  incisive overview of the current state of materials design in language  teaching. Seventeen original chapters explore the issues involved in the  design, implementation, and evaluation of materials in language programs in  a wide variety of settings and contexts. This stimulating collection  considers different approaches to materials design - including  teacher-developed classroom materials, commercial materials, and  technology-driven materials. Discussion questions and tasks follow each  chapter to make this volume useful to both prospective and practicing  teachers alike.
