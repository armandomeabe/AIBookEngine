ONE LONELY FISH - BOARD BOOKIt begins with one lonely fish... Count along from one to ten, as each fish gobbles up the next. Just be careful - this book might bite! A clever concept based around the simple act of counting. Turn the page to see a fish on each spread, and count along as a fish on each page gobbles up the one before it. Then the ultimate finale - a huge mouth dominates the last page, gobbling every fish in its path... And we are back once again to one lonely fish!Edad recomendada: a partir de 1 a√±o
