Joy and heartbreak combine in this bittersweet tale of a champion  greyhound's journey through life -- and from owner to owner! "The sack  wasn't just drifting gently along like everything else, it was turning of  its own accord. There was definitely something inside it, struggling against  the side of the plastic bag, kicking at it, squeaking and squealing in  terror. He had no idea what it might be, only that it was alive and in  danger of drowning." When Patrick saves a litter of greyhound puppies from  the canal, he can't bear to hand them all over to the RSPCA. He pleads with  his parents: couldn't he just keep one of them? But nothing will convince  them and Patrick cries himself to sleep -- only to be woken by a greyhound  puppy licking his face! Patrick christens his puppy Best Mate, and that's  what he becomes. Patrick's favourite thing is to watch Best Mate running at  full stretch on the heath, a speeding bullet, a cheetah-dog. Until one day  Best Mate is kidnapped by a greyhound trainer, and begins a new life as a  champion race dog. Suzie, the greyhound trainer's step-daughter, loves Best  Mate on first sight and gives him a new name, Bright Eyes. But what will  happen when he can't run any more?
