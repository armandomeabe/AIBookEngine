From the excellent Laura Ellen Anderson, this is a very funny picture book about taking notice of the quieter things in life.Stairs are for STOMPING,spoons are for DRUMMING,and when my mum's working,I help her by HUMMING.Making noise is a LOT of fun ... but what happens when you take the time to really listen to your world around you? Perfect for little people who love banging and popping, and whizzing and fizzing.Laura Ellen Anderson is the author/illustrator of the internationally successful I Don't Want Curly Hair and the bestselling Amelia Fang series.
