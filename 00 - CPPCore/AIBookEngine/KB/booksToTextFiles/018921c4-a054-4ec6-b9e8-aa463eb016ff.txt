Seamus Heaney's new collection starts 'in an age of bare hands and cast  iron' and ends 'as the automatic lock / clunks shut' in the eerie new  conditions of a menaced twenty-first century. In their haunted, almost  visionary clarity, the poems assay the weight and worth of what has been  held in the hand and in the memory. Images out of a childhood spent safe  from the horrors of World War II - railway sleepers, a sledgehammer, the  'heavyweight silence' of cattle out in rain - are coloured by a strongly  contemporary sense that 'anything can happen', and other images from the  dangerous present - a journey on the underground, a melting glacier - are  fraught with this same anxiety.    But District and Circle , which includes a number of prose poems and  translations, offers resistance as the poet gathers his staying powers and  stands his ground in the hiding places of love and excited language. In a  sequence like 'The Tollund Man in Springtime' and in several poems which 'do  the rounds of the district' - its known roads and rivers and trees, its  familiar and unfamiliar ghosts - the gravity of memorial is transformed into  the grace of recollection. With more relish and conviction than ever, Seamus  Heaney maintains his trust in the obduracy of workaday realities and the  mystery of everyday renewals:    Again the growl   Of shutting doors, the jolt and one-off treble     Of iron on iron, then a long centrifugal     Haulage of speed through every dragging socket.
