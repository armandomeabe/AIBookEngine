According to most scientists, Earth's atmosphere has warmed by about 1.4  degrees Fahrenheit in the past 100 years. The result has been melting  glaciers, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. Some people  say that current climate change is part of the natural cycle of changes on  Earth. Many scientists, however, think that Earth's climate is changing  because of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. "Climate Change"  examines how countries around the world are taking steps, such as  conservation, to lessen the effects of climate change.  Case Study: Caribbean Island / Antarctica
