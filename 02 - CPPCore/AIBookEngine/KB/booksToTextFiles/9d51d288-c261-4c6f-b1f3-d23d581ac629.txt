Phoebe's class is going on a field trip to a farm to learn about where food  comes from. Phoebe and her friends can't wait to collect eggs from chickens,  watch goats get milked, pick apples, and help make a farm fresh lunch. But  when Phoebe and Sage decide to help goats by opening their gate, a peaceful  field trip turns into a wild, noisy adventure. Before long, they learn an  important lesson about farm animals-and in telling the truth!
