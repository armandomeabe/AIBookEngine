THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE - WORDSWOTH CLASSICS OF WORLD LITERATURE Abridged and with an Introduction by Antony Lentin and Brian Norman.Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published between 1776 and 1788, is the undisputed masterpiece of English historical writing which can only perish with the language itself.
