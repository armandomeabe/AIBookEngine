Rainbow Six is a nerve-shredding thriller from international bestseller, Tom Clancy. Newly named head of an elite multinational task force, John Clark faces the world's greatest fear: international terrorism. And following each terrifying new outbreak - the ghosts from his own past. The challenge of a new mission is just what Clark needs, but the opportunities come faster than he expected. Hostage-taking at a Swiss bank. The kidnapping of an international trader. Carnage at a theme park in Spain. Each incident seems separate, yet the timing disturbs Clark. Is there a connection? Is he being tested? Or is there a bigger threat out there, from terrorists so extreme that no government is ready to admit their existence. Rainbow Six is Tom Clancy at his thrilling best, and is the second John Clark novel. Clancy is also the author of international bestsellers Against All Enemies, Dead or Alive and Locked On.
