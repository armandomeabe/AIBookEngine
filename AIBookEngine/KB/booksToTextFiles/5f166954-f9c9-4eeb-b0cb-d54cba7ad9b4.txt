Edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, Professor of English  Literature, University of Sussex     The Merchant of Venice is one of Shakespeare's most popular comedies, but it  remains deeply controversial. The text may well seem anti-Semitic; yet  repeatedly, in performance, it has revealed a contrasting nature. Shylock,  though vanquished in the law-court, often triumphs in the theatre. He is a  character so intense that he can dominate the play, challenging abrasively  its romantic and lyrical affirmations.
