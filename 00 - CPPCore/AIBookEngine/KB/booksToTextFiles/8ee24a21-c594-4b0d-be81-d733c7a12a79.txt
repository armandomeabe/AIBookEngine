Set in the mid-19th century, and written from the author's first-hand  experience, North and South follows the story of the heroine's movement from  the tranquil but moribund ways of southern England to the vital but  turbulent north. Elizabeth Gaskell's skilful narrative uses an unusual love  story to show how personal and public lives were woven together in a newly  industrial society.    This is a tale of hard-won triumphs - of rational thought over prejudice and  of humane care over blind deference to the market. Readers in the  twenty-first century will find themselves absorbed as this Victorian novel  traces the origins of problems and possibilities which are still challenging  a hundred and fifty years later: the complex relationships, public and  private, between men and women of different classes.
