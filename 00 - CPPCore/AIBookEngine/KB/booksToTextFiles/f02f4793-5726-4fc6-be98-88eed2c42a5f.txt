Interactive is an exciting four-level course for teenage learners from  elementary to upper-intermediate levels (CEF A2-B2). The Workbook provides  additional practice in the language introduced in the Student's Book.  Portfolio sections offer an alternative writing activity and there is one  core listening text, plus additional listening practice for each unit.  Vocabulary practice for every unit is extended further. 'Help yourself'  boxes highlight key grammar points and offer extra language practice.    A 24-page grammar section at the back of the Workbook offers a 'Grammar  Reference' and 'Grammar Practice' linked to every unit of the Student's  Book.
