A New Yorker, trying not to be jaded, accompanies a cash-strapped pot grower to a 'Clothing Optional Resort' in California. A nerdy high schooler has her first sexual experience at geology camp. On the night of her father's funeral, a college student watches an old video of her Bat Mitzvah, hypnotized by the image of the girl she used to be . . .Frank and irreverent, these stories offer a singular view of growing up (or not) and finding love (or not) in today's uncertain landscape.
