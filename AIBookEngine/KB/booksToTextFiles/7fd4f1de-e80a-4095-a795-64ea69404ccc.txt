On the night of the fifth of July, in Red Wing, Minnesota, a boy smelled  death in a cornfield off an abandoned farm. When the county deputy took a  look, he found a body stuffed in a cistern. Then another. And another. By  the time Lucas Davenport was called in, it was fifteen and counting, the  victims killed over just as many summers, regular as clockwork.    How could this happen in a town so small without anyone noticing? And with  the latest victim only two weeks dead, Davenport knows the killer is still  at work, still close by. Most likely someone the folks of Red Wing see every  day. Won't they be surprised.
