Engage Second Edition retains its successful topic-based learning approach,  but now has a revised syllabus providing even greater support for students  and teachers. The fresh design and up-to-date content are attractive to  teenagers, and the improved unit structure develops confidence and  motivation. Extra materials for teachers, and a full range of digital  components, allow for flexibility, and there is also support for mixed  ability classes.
