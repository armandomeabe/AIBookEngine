Can average be amazing? The bestselling author of Frindle shows that with a little kindness, it can.Jordan Johnston is average. Not short, not tall. Not plump, not slim. Not gifted, not flunking out. Even her shoe size is average. She's ordinary for her school, for her town, for even the whole wide world, it seems.Then Marlea Harkins, one of the most popular girls in school-and most definitely the meanest-does something unthinkable, and suddenly nice, average Jordan isn't thinking average thoughts anymore. She wants to get Marlea back! But what's the best way to beat a bully? Could it be with kindness?Called "a genius of gentle, high concept tales set in suburban middle school" by The New York Times, bestselling author Andrew Clements presents a compelling story of the greatest achievement possible-self-acceptance.
