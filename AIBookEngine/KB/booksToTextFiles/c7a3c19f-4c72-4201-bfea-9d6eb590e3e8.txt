Nikki Maxwell has been doing everything she can to keep everyone at school  from learning the truth--that she's there on scholarship in exchange for her  Dad working as the school's exterminator. The last thing Nikki needs is  having her friends and--worst case scenario--her crush, Brandon, associating  her with the humongous roach on top of her Dad's van! Now it looks like her  secret could be about to come out, and Nikki's willing to go to any zany and  wacky length to prevent that from happening. The timing seems perfect when a  major talent competition is announced with a school scholarship offered as  the top prize. Nikki loves to sing and dance and now she gets to have tons  of fun with her friends while competing for a chance to free her Dad from  his obligation! (And free herself from all that potential damage to her  reputation . . .) Once again, hijinks and misunderstandings aplenty ensue,  as well as more hilarious and heartwarming moments with Nikki and her  friends.
