Ever since the devastation and tragedy of the events of 11 September 2001, the architectural community has been thinking imaginatively about the large, vacant site consisting of 16 acres in Lower Manhattan. This has encouraged innovative ideas about architecture and urbanism that have not been seen in decades. This book reports on and analyses the developments, taking a panoptic but concentrated look at the state of architectural creativity and problem-solving today.
