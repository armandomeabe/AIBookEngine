The spotlight's on Ella as the world's cutest elephant prepares for a school talent show - and wonders if she has anything special to offer at all. "The calm, confident tone of the text is a fine match for the whimsical illustrations that convey Ella's charmingly old-fashioned world on Elephant Island. Though the story has a nostalgic flavor, Ella's concerns are timeless." - Kirkus Reviews.
