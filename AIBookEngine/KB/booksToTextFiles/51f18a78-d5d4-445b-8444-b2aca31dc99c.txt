A fabulous adventure for children by Robert C. O'Brien about super-intelligent rats.They are not like other rats. They work at night, in secret . . . Time is running out for Mrs Frisby, a widowed mouse with four small children. She must move her family before the farmer destroys their home. But her youngest son, Timothy, lies ill with pneumonia and is too sick to be taken on such a perilous journey.Help comes in the unexpected form of a highly extraordinary breed of super-intelligent rats. The rats of NIMH come up with a brilliant solution to Mrs Frisby's problem and she, in turn, renders them a great service, but the rats are in danger too, and little by little Mrs Frisby discovers their extraordinary past . . .Robert C. O'Brien was, in private life, Robert Conly, senior assistant editor of National Geographic Magazine where he worked for over twenty years. He wrote three books for children and one for adults and won the Newbery Medal for MRS FRISBY AND THE RATS OF NIMH, filmed as THE SECRETS OF NIMH. Robert C. O'Brien died in 1973.
