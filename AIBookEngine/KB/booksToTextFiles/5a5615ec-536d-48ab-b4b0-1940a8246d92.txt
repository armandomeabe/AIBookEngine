FINGER PHONICS BIG BOOKS 1-7The Finger Phonics Big Books introduce young children to all of the letter sounds, not just the alphabet. The teaching is multi-sensory. Each letter sound is introduced with a detailed illustration, a simple story, an action and a large formation letter. As the children's letter-sound knowledge builds up, blending words (which use only known letter sounds) are included for early reading practice. The wipe-clean plastic sheet can be clipped to the activity pages at the end of each book for fun and engaging whole-class teaching. These refreshed editions are the same as previous editions in terms of number of pages, pagination and core content, but have been enhanced with: • New cover designs, colour-coded to match each group of letter sounds across other Jolly Phonics resources • Fresh and new full-page illustrations for each page • New-style, easy-to-follow letter formation guides • Information panels showing how to use each page • Additional items within each picture to tie in with the vocabulary taught in Jolly English • Updated activities at the end of each book to align with other Jolly Phonics resourcesEdad recomendada: a partir de 3 años
