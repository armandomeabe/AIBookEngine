Vibrantly illustrated by Mariana Ruiz Johnson, this enchanting pop-up book takes a peek inside six different animal homes. Little ones will love lifting the flaps and opening the gatefolds to make each scene come to life. With short, accessible text and lots to spot on every page, these playful scenes are just the thing to help very young readers understand animal homes and behaviour.
