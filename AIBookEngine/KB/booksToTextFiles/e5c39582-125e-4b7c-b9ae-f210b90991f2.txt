Ninety minutes.A few years from now, not too far in the future, two people meet.It is a classic story of boy meets girl.Except that it's not.When we find them, they have an hour and a half left.Unless they can save themselves, they won't survive.The clock is ticking.Bittersweet and life-affirming, Hold Back the Stars is the love story of the year.SOON TO BE A FILM STARRING JOHN BOYEGA AND LETITIA WRIGHT
