We are working with Cambridge International Examinations to gain endorsement for this title.Access to a wide range of activities and types of investigations so you can deliver the Science mastery approach, as recommended by Cambridge International Examinations.- Establish previous knowledge, skills and understanding of concepts with a student-led investigation at the start of each unit, and then determine whether learners have properly mastered the objectives with another at the end.- Question and build on previous work, with key scientific words for students to learn and practice, plus talk partner activities for peer assessment opportunities.- Encourage students to predict and question the outcomes and concepts investigations that demonstrate and test key scientific points.- Includes a practice test at the end of each chapter for summative assessment purposes.The science mastery approachThe mastery approach gives teachers the time to focus on a specific idea or skill until they are confident their students have 'mastered' it, rather than moving on quickly with only a superficial understanding. It does this by finding out what students know, then uses formative assessments and engages students in self-assessment to establish how successful they are in their learning.
