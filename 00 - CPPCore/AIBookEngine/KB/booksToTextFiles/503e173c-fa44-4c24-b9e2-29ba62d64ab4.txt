Alvina has two grannies who she loves with all her heart. Grannie Vero is from the Caribbean island of Trinidad. Grannie Rose is from the north of England. When Alvina's parents go away on holiday, both the grannies move in to Alvina's house to look after her. But the two grannies want to do different things, eat different food, play different games and tell different stories. The grannies get crosser and crosser with each other, but Alvina thinks of a way they can do all the things their own way so the grannies can become the best of friends.
