Michelina Bellsong is on a mission. She is following a missing family to the edge of America . . . to a place she never knew existed-a place of terror, wonder, and shattering revelation. What awaits her there will change her life and the life of everyone she knows-if she can find the key to survival. At stake are a young girl of extraordinary goodness, a young boy with killers on his trail, and Micky's own wounded soul. Ahead lie incredible peril, startling discoveries, and paths that lead through terrible darkness to unexpected light.
