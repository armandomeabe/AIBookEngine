Move over, Bridget Jones s diary: She s back, and this time she s texting  and tweeting. . . Fourteen years after landing Mark Darcy, Bridget s life  has taken her places she never expected. But despite the new challenges of  single parenting, online dating, wildly morphing dress sizes, and bafflingly  complex remote controls, she is the same irrepressible and endearing soul we  all remember though her talent for embarrassing herself in hilarious ways  has become dangerously amplified now that she has 752 Twitter followers. As  Bridget navigates head lice epidemics, school-picnic humiliations, and  cross-generational sex, she learns that life isn t over when you start  needing reading glasses and why one should never, ever text while drunk.  Studded with witty observations about the perils and absurdities of our  times, "Mad About the Boy" is both outrageously comic and genuinely moving.  As we watch her dealing with heartbreaking loss and rediscovering love and  joy, Bridget invites us to fall for her all over again."
