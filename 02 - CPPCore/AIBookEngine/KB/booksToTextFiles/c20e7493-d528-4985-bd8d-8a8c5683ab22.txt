THE DISCOURSESThe Discourses of Epictetus are a series of extracts of the teachings of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus written down by Arrian c. 108 AD. There were originally eight books, but only four now remain in their entirety, along with a few fragments of the others. This edition includes the Discourses, and two minor works, the Fragments, and the Manual, also known as the Enchiridion.EPICTETUS(Hierapolis, 55 - Nicopolis, 135) Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was probably born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey), and lived in Rome until his exile to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece, where he lived most of his life and died. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses.Edad recomendada: Adultos.
