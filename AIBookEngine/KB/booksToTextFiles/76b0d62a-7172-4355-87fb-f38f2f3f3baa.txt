heres a a reckoning on the way ... and Sookie has a knack for being in troubles way; not least when she witnesses the firebombing of Merlottes. the bar where she works. Since Sam Merlotte is known to be two-natured. suspicion immediately falls on the anti-shifters in the area. Sookie suspects otherwise. but before she can investigate something else - something even more dangerous - comes up. Sookies lover Eric Northman and his child Pam are plotting something in secret. Whatever it is. they seem determined to keep Sookie out of it; almost as determined as Sookie is to find out whats going on. She cant sit on the sidelines when both her work and her love life under threat - but as shes gradually drawn into their plans Sookie finds the situation is deadlier than she could ever have imagined.
