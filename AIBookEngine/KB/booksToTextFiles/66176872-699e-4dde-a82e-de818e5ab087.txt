Focus.By P. Reilly, M. Uminska & B. Michalowski.Focus is a rich, varied, carefully levelled course for upper secondary students. Specially designed to motivate older teens, Focus helps students prepare for exam success. With its unique blended learning package, Focus is the flexible course that gets results.Focus on exam preparation.Focus offers targeted development of exam skills.Starting from the very first level of the course students are offered regular exposure to EXAM-TYPE TASKS and exam reference. Focus is the first upper secondary course to offer a separate material devoted particularly to exam preparation.Focus on vocabulary.The course offers the Word Store - a vocabulary practice booklet with a wide variety of exercises and a unique method of involving learners actively in recording new words and phrases.Focus on 21st century skills.21st Century Learning is embedded throughout Focus, because teaching upper secondary students to use English confidently in the 21st Century is no longer a special feature for an ELT course - it is an essential one.Focus on teacher's support.Focus offers a variety of resources for teachers to adapt to their teaching styles, students' needs or extra teaching time available.Focus on students' resources.Extra resources for students, including audio resources and videos, can be found on a student dedicated website.
