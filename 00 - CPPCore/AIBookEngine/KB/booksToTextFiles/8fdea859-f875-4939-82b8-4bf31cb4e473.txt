She was never put in school, never taken to the doctor. She did not even have a birth certificate until she was nine years old.At sixteen, to escape her father's radicalism and a violent older brother, Tara left home. What followed was a struggle for self-invention, a journey that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes, and the will to change it.'It will make your heart soar' Guardian'Jaw-dropping and inspiring, everyone should read this book' Stylist'Absolutely superb . . . so gripping I could hardly breathe' Sophie HannahTARA WESTOVERTara Jane Westover (born September 27, 1986) is an American memoirist, essayist and historian.
