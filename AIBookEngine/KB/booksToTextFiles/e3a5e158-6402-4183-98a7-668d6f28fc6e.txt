Action Research for Language Teachers  View full components listing for Action Research for Language Teachers  Michael J. Wallace  Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh    This practical guide can be used by teachers who wish to develop their  professional expertise by investigating their own teaching in a systematic  and organised way. It is also invaluable for teachers or trainee teachers  who have to produce a professional project or dissertation as part of a  training programme. This will help teachers to design and implement a  research project which is derived from their normal practice, with results  which should be of direct relevance to them. It is user-friendly and  includes: - exemplar articles and extracts which show how the research  techniques can be implemented - 'Personal review' sections which help  readers to think about the ideas being discussed and relate them to their  own situation - commentaries which follow up issues raised in the 'Personal  review' sections - chapter summaries - a glossary of all technical terms.
