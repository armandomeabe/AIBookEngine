Step back in time for the ultimate adventure. Are you smart enough to take on a pharaoh in Ancient Egypt, debate with philosophers in Ancient Greece, outwit a centurion in Ancient Rome, and battle with a knight in a medieval castle? Readers must use their problem-solving skills and historical knowledge to navigate through four thrilling adventures. History Quest follows the popular Maths Quest series. Questions are carefully chosen to address all aspects of life in the past. Finding the answers enables readers to advance through the story, learning more about history with every step they take. Clues are dotted along the way, and wrong turns will direct readers toward the right answer! Graphic illustrations and puzzles bring the past to life, and a glossary explains historical terms and provides added reference material.
