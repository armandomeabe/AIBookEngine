A Game of Thrones, was good, get prepared for a Clash of Kings!  In an incredible feat of storytelling, Martin has upped the standard yet  again, something I thought could not be done after the monumental  achievement of A Game of Thrones. The intrigue continues, more hell breaks  loose, and power never seems to stay in one place for long.    For those that read Martin's first book in the series, he delivers  again--the plot is just as unpredictable, the characters are developed some  more, and new POVs are added to the roster (Theon and Davos). For those  thinking they can start from here--I wouldn't try it. There is a huge cast  of characters in very intricate situations layered in shady motives,  loyalties, and betrayals--starting here would be very difficult. That is not  to say that this book is confusing, however; all the characters are  realistic and memorable, so fans will find they know House leaders,  retainers, and knights without really making an effort to learn them in the  first place.
