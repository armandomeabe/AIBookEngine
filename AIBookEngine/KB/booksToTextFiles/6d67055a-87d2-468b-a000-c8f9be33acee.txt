Told with P. D. James's trademark suspense, insightful characterization, and  riveting storytelling, The Children of Men is a story of a world with no  children and no future. The human race has become infertile, and the last  generation to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling as  suicide and despair become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron,  apathetic toward a future without a future, spends most of his time  reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian, a bright, attractive woman who  wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin, the powerful Warden  of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may just awaken his  desire to live . . . and they may also hold the key to survival for the  human race.
