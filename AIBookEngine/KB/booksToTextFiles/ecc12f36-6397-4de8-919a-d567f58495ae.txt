Originally published in 1912, "The Lost World" is Arthur Conan Doyle's classic tale of discovery and adventure. The story begins with the curious and intrepid reporter Edward Malone, meeting Professor Challenger, a strange and brilliant paleontologist who insists that he has found dinosaurs still alive deep in the Amazon. Malone agrees to accompany Challenger, as well as Challenger's unconvinced colleague Professor Summerlee, and the adventurer Lord John Roxton, into the wilds of South America and the Amazon in search of Challenger's fantastical beasts. There, cut off from the rest of civilization and high atop an isolated plateau, the explorers find themselves in an amazing land of extinct dinosaurs, a native tribe, and a group of ape-like creatures. The party is drawn into a violent battle when they are taken captive by the ape men and must use their cunning and resourcefulness to escape and save the lives of their party and the other captured native tribesmen. Immensely popular and influential, "The Lost World" is a classic tale of science-fiction adventure that continues to inspire and captivate to this day.
