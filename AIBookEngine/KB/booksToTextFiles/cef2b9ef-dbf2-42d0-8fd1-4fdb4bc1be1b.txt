When the human and the vampire worlds collide, there will be hell to pay.     Luca Ambrus is a rare breed: vampire from birth, begotten by vampire  parents, blood born. He is also an agent of the Council-the centuries-old  cabal that governs vampirekind, preserving their secrecy and destroying  those who betray them.    When a cryptic summons leads him to the scene of the brutal killing of a  powerful Council member, Luca begins the hunt for an assassin among his own  people. But instead of a lone killer he discovers a sinister conspiracy of  rogue vampires bent on subjugating the mortal world.    All that stands in their way are the conduits, humans able to channel spirit  warriors into the physical world to protect mankind. Chloe Fallon is a  conduit-and a target of the vampire assassin who's killing them. When Luca  saves her life, an irresistible bond of trust-along with more passionate  feelings-is forged between them. As more victims fall, Chloe and Luca have  only each other to depend on to save the world from the reign of  monsters-and salvage their own future together.
