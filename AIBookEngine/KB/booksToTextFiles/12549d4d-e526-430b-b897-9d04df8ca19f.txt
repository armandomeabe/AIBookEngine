You wake up. You go to work. You have strategy meetings about how to use hashtags. After work you get so blackout drunk you can't remember the circumstances which have led you to waking up next to your colleague. The next day you stay in bed, scrolling through your social media feeds and wondering why everyone else seems to be achieving so much.Then you hear about Life on Nyx, a programme that offers the chance to move to another planet and start a new, meaningful way of life. But there's a caveat: if you go, you can never come back.
