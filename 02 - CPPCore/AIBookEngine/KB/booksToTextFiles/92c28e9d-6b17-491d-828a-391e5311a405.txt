Sometimes all you can do is fly away home . . .     When Sylvie Serfer met Richard Woodruff in law school, she had wild curls,  wide hips, and lots of opinions. Decades later, Sylvie has remade herself as  the ideal politician's wife-her hair dyed and straightened, her hippie-chick  wardrobe replaced by tailored knit suits. At fifty-seven, she ruefully  acknowledges that her job is staying twenty pounds thinner than she was in  her twenties and tending to her husband, the senator.     Lizzie, the Woodruffs' younger daughter, is at twenty-four a recovering  addict, whose mantra HALT (Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?) helps her keep her  life under control. Still, trouble always seems to find her. Her older  sister, Diana, an emergency room physician, has everything Lizzie failed to  achieve-a husband, a young son, the perfect home-and yet she's trapped in a  loveless marriage. With temptation waiting in one of the ER's exam rooms,  she finds herself craving more.     After Richard's extramarital affair makes headlines, the three women are  drawn into the painful glare of the national spotlight. Once the press  conference is over, each is forced to reconsider her life, who she is and  who she is meant to be.       Written with an irresistible blend of heartbreak and hilarity, Fly Away Home  is an unforgettable story of a mother and two daughters who after a lifetime  of distance finally learn to find refuge in one another
