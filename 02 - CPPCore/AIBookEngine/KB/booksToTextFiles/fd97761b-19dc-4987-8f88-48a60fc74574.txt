PERSONAL BEST A2 ELEMENTARY SPLIT A - 978-950-46-6248-8LOUIS ROGERProbably like many people from the UK working in TEFL, I planned to travel for one or two years before getting a 'real' job. However, I soon realised it IS a real profession with a wide range of people from all sorts of backgrounds working in it. Even today this is still what I enjoy most about TEFL; the diversity of colleagues and students to work with. I have been lucky enough to have lived and worked in various countries around the world including the UK, Germany, Portugal and Italy. Much of this teaching has been to adults or young adults and mostly in variations of English for specific purposes, in particular exams, business and academic study. Working in these fields has highlighted to me the importance of giving people specific language to meet their immediate needs but also making sure it is as transferable as possible as people's needs change rapidly.SINOPSISWelcome to Personal Best, Richmond's brand-new course for young adult learners of English.
