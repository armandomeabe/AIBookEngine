Newland Archer, heir to one of New York City's best families, is planning a proper marriage, a perfect product of New York society. One night he meets May's cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska. This exotic and beautiful woman has returned to New York from Poland after a mysterious scandal. Newland becomes caught in a battle between duty and mystery, between tradition and the power of love."Newland felt more and more embarrassed.
