A GHOST IN LOVE AND OTHER PLAYS.    Do you believe in ghosts? Jerry doesn't. He's a nineteen-year-old American,  who just wants a good holiday with his friend, Brad. They are travelling  round the north of England by bicycle. But strange things begin to happen in  the small hotel where they are staying. First, Brad seems to think that he  has been there before. And then a girl called Ellen appears . . . The first  of these three original plays is set in the seventeenth century, and the  other two take place in modern times. In each play, a ghost comes back from  the dead to change the lives of living people.
