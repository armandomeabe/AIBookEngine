Christophe's story can help him fit into his new life, if he has the courage to tell itâ€¦ Christophe has a story inside him - and this story wants to be told. But with a new country, a new school and a new language to cope with, Christophe can't find the right words. He wants to tell the whole school why he had to leave Rwanda, why he has a scar made by a bullet from a soldier's gun and what happened to his baby brother, but has he got the courage to be a storyteller? Christophe must find a way to break through all these barriers, so he can share his story with everyone.
