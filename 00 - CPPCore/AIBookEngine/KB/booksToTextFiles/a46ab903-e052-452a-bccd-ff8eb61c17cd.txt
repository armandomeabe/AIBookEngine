LA CHACHA'S - EMPANADAS - TAPA DURAKnown as La Chacha, María del Carmen Vicario is one of Argentina's best empanaderas (empanada makers). In 2019, her Mendoza empanadas were anointed the country's best in a competition against other empanaderas from provinces such as Tucumán, Salta and Jujuy. In this book, besides sharing the secrets and recipes behind her Mendoza meat pies -as well as many typical sweets that go so well with yerba mate tea- La Chacha aslo invites you to meet her colleagues, other female empanaderas, who maintain and celebrate a tradition that is core to Argentine identity. La Chacha has worked at La Casa del Visitante, one of the Zuccardi family's restaurants in Maipú, Mendoza, for more than 15 years and from that kitchen, she shows how it is possible to cook up a present and a future in the region's gastronomical development.Edad recomendada: Adultos.
