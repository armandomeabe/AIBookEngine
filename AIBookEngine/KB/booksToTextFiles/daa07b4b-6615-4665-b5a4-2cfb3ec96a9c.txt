MY WISH FOR THE WORLD For fans of The Invisible String and I Wish You More, this hopeful picture book follows a mother and son at bedtime as they dream of a better world by wishing for kindness, community, and helpfulness. At bedtime, a child asks his mother what it is that she wishes for.

No matter her wish, one thing is clear: there are lots of ways to show and encourage kindness.With gentle rhyme and lyricism, this loving read aloud delivers a comforting message about the role kindness plays in our everyday lives. It's a gentle reminder that our wishes, when put into action, can help improve the world.Perfect for:- Parents, grandparents, and educators-this is a great conversation starter!- Gift givers in search of heartfelt and hopeful books about world peace- Readers who want to discuss the impactful ways children can help make the world a better place"A lovely book; these messages will make children aware that simple acts can make a big difference for everyone." -School Library JournalKRISTINE LOMBARDIKristine A.
