Level: B1 / Intermediate  This is a new and lively course for teenagers. It aims to build up their  general English skills while gently easing them into more tailored PET and  FCE exam practice. The clear yet integrated approach develops reading,  writing, listening and speaking skills whilst there is systematic build-up  of topic-based lexis and lexico-grammar.  The topic-based units cover general topics common to international exams,  but these are approached in a way that is appropriate to the experience and  interest of the target age group.
