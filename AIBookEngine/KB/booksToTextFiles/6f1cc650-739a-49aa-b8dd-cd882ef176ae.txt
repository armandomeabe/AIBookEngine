Energy use is one of the key issues of our time. People have traditionally  relied on fossil fuels, including oil, coal, and natural gas. There are  growing concerns, though, about the pollution caused by these energy  resources. In addition, these sources of energy are nonrenewable. That is,  they can be used up. Countries around the world are exploring ways to use  renewable sources of energy, such as solar power. "Energy Resources"  examines the role of traditional sources of energy and the development of  alternative energy resources.  Case Study: Brazil / Russia
