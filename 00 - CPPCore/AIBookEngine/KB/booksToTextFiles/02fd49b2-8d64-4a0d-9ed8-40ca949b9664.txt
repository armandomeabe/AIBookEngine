In her best-selling debut, Commencement, J. Courtney Sullivan explored the  complicated and contradictory landscape of female friendship. Now, in her  highly anticipated second novel, Sullivan takes us into even richer  territory, introducing four unforgettable women who have nothing in common  but the fact that, like it or not, they're family.     For the Kellehers, Maine is a place where children run in packs, showers are  taken outdoors, and old Irish songs are sung around a piano. Their  beachfront property, won on a barroom bet after the war, sits on three acres  of sand and pine nestled between stretches of rocky coast, with one tree  bearing the initials "A.H." At the cottage, built by Kelleher hands,  cocktail hour follows morning mass, nosy grandchildren snoop in drawers, and  decades-old grudges simmer beneath the surface.     As three generations of Kelleher women descend on the property one summer,  each brings her own hopes and fears. Maggie is thirty-two and pregnant,  waiting for the perfect moment to tell her imperfect boyfriend the news; Ann  Marie, a Kelleher by marriage, is channeling her domestic frustration into a  dollhouse obsession and an ill-advised crush; Kathleen, the black sheep,  never wanted to set foot in the cottage again; and Alice, the matriarch at  the center of it all, would trade every floorboard for a chance to undo the  events of one night, long ago.    By turns wickedly funny and achingly sad, Maine unveils the sibling rivalry,  alcoholism, social climbing, and Catholic guilt at the center of one family,  along with the abiding, often irrational love that keeps them coming back,  every summer, to Maine and to each other.
