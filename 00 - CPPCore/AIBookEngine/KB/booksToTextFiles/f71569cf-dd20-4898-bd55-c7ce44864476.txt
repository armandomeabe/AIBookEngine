A fun first alphabetic picture dictionary to introduce children aged 4 upwards to reading and writing and looking up words. It has over 500 words listed in alphabetical order, each with an illustration and a useful phrase. The alphabet down the side of each page, with the appropriate letterhighlighted, teaches first navigation skills. Additional thematic sections at the back focus on themes - including words from the calendar, outer space, fairy tales, plus the everyday world of the classroom and the playground. Val Biro's delightful animals and other characters make this the most attractive introduction to first dictionary skills.
