PRINCESS OLIVIA INVESTIGATES: THE WRONG WEATHERThe brand new series for young readers from bestselling author Lucy Hawking.'The more we find out about the world around us, the more we can work out other, more complicated things, such as how the universe began or how life got started on Earth . . .'Olivia Alez is delighted about finally living a life away from the royal palace in the mountains that used to be her home, after the Kingdom of Alez decides it doesn't want a royal family any more. Now she can finally give up boring princess lessons and learn about real things, like volcanoes and the ocean and space!But Olivia is completely unprepared for the world that awaits her. Thick, dark clouds hang low over the city, and the rivers that she so longed to see are choked with rubbish. And on top of it all, the weather just feels wrong. With scorching hot sun one day and torrential rainfall the next, it seems nearly impossible for the people and animals in Alez to adapt to their extreme climate.Olivia, horrified by what she sees, becomes determined to get to the bottom of Alez's dangerous weather patterns. With the help of some new friends and armed with a scientific lab coat that would make Albert Einstein jealous, Olivia sets out to solve the mystery and save Alez from climate destruction before it's too late . . .LUCY HAWKINGLUCY HAWKING is a children's writer, the co-creator of non-fiction compendium Unlocking the Universe and the George fiction series, with her father Stephen Hawking.
