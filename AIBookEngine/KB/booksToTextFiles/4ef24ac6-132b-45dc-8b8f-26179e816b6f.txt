Interactive is an exciting four-level course for teenage learners from  elementary to upper-intermediate levels (CEF A2-B2). The Level 3 DVD (PAL)  provides visual dramatisations of all Pronunciation and Interaction sections  from each unit of the Student's Book. A Talking Heads section shows  teenagers using real language and unscripted responses. A series of  teen-presented Interviews focus on aspects of UK culture using relevant  grammar and vocabulary covered in the Student's Book.    Accompanying activities which include further speaking practice are  available from the course website: http://interactive.cambridge.org
