Vina Apsara, a famous and much loved singer with a wild and irresistible  voice, is caught up in a devastating earthquake and never seen again.  This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks  and again finds her, over and over throughout his own extraordinary life in  music. Set in the inspiring, vain, fabulous world of rock'n'roll, this is  the story of a love that streches across continents, across Vina and Ormus's  whole lives, and even beyond death.
